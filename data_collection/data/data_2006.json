The plane disappeared from radar screens just under four miles from shore and crashed after making a turn and heading toward Adler airport for a landing. Pilot error. The captain, being in a psychoemotional stress condition, made nose down control inputs due to the loss of pitch and roll awareness.This started the abnormal situation. The captain's insufficient pitch control inputs led to a failure to recover the aircraft and caused it to crash. Along with the inadequate control inputs from the captain, the contributing factors of the crash were also the lack of monitoring the aircraft's pitch attitude, altitude and vertical speed by the first officer and no proper reaction by the crew to GPWS warnings.", "On a climbout after a touch-and-go landing, the aircraft veered to the left, lost altitude and crashed in a wooded area 1 nm northwest of the airport.", "The aircraft disappeared from radar screens while on approach to S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 Island.

After an aborted first try the plane circled for another attempt but struck a mountainside.

Contributing to the accident were the low clouds.", "The cargo plane crashed after reporting engine problems while en route .", "The plane disappeared from radar shortly after making a distress call. A distress call was made at FL330 and again at FL100. The aircraft was reportly on fire before it crashed. The plane crashed in a field, 30 miles North of Donetsk and broke-up.

The plane accelerated to 137 knots befoe it ran off the end of the runway, ran through an airport perimeter fence and impacted trees on an adjacent horse farm and burst into flames. The takeoff sequence took about 36 seconds.  The aircraft was still on the ground as the plane ran off the runway.The plane came to rest about 1,800 feet past the runway. It was dark with light rain at the time of the accident. The copilot was at the controls but it was the captain who taxied the plane into position for take off. The copilot was the lone survivor. The flight crew's failure to use available cues and aids to identify the airplane's location on the airport surface during taxi and their failure to cross check and verify that the airplane was on the correct runway before takeoff. Contributing to this accident were the flight crew's nonpertinent conversation during taxi, which resulted in loss of positional awareness and the Federal Aviation Administration's failure to require that all runway crossings be authorized only by specific air traffic control clearances.", "The plane crashed while attempting to land.

Five passengers and two crew members on the Embraer were not injured. All 154 on board the 737 were killed. The flight recorder transcript from the executive jet showed that the pilots were told by Brazilian air traffic control to fly at the same altitude as the Boeing 737 before the planes collided. A Brazilian Air Force investigation concluded that a switched-off transponder on the EMB-135 contributed the plane crash. The report also said flight controllers failed to alert the pilots they were on a collision course and failed to notice the transponder was turned off.", "While attempting to land, the charter plane skidded off the end of the runway, slid down an embankment and caught fire. One survivor was seriously hurt, eleven others were not seriously injured. Burning fuel in the cabin was the main reason three passengers and one crew member died and six others were badly injured. All six spoilers failed while landing. Even with the failed spoilers, a damp runway and a slight tailwind, there should have been sufficient room to stop. However, when the pilots realized the spoilers had failed, one of them selected emergency braking not realizing that this deactivated the antilock braking system.", "The plane belonging to Uzbekistan Airways and carrying Uzbek servicemen, crashed after losing control while attempting to land in poor weather conditions.
