As a result, the aircraft hit an instrument landing building and crashed into a rail yard.", "The cargo plane crashed while attempting to land.", "Crashed on final approach. Pilot fatigue. The pilot did not follow the recommended procedure for instrument final approach and he descended below the height prescribed in the final approach chart.", "Lost an engine on takeoff and crashed into trees and caught fire.", "Crashed in a mountainous area located 39 km from the airport in the Zimathan district while en route.", "While on instrument approach, the aircraft hit a sign and crashed through the airport boundry fence.  Momentary disorientation caused by the loss of visual reference during the final visual phase of the approach resulting in an increased rate of descent at an altitude too low to effect recovery.", "On a flight from London, England to Tel Aviv, the aircraft drifted over Bulgarian airspace and was shot down by Bulgarian jet fighters. A navigational error that probably originated with an incorrect radio compass indication due to the effects of thunderstorm activity in the area.", "The aircraft attempted an emergency landing at a military airstrip after fire broke out in the No. 2 engine. The right wing separated from the aircraft and crashed 1.5 miles from the runway. Installation of an unairworthy cylinder in the No. 2 engine which resulted in an uncontrollable fire and loss of the right wing.", "The right engine caught on fire due to a fuel leak leading to distruction of the plane in the air.", "Participating in a U.S. military exercise, the two planes collided in midair while in formation after one of the planes pulled out of formation because of engine trouble. The accident occurred at an altitude of 4,000 feet.  Forty-six aboard 7841 and 20 aboard 3222 were killed.", "Hit Caparao Mountain while en route, 1 hour after taking off.  Failure to follow flight plan.", "The cargo plane lifted off too early, stalled and crashed. The pilot tried to avoid a person on the runway.", "Flew into Mount Popa located about 45 km east of Lanywa.", "The plane returned after failure of the No. 2 engine, stalled and crashed 200 yards short of the runway  into parked aircraft and a hanger.  The captain's commitment to a landing without radio or visual confirmation of his runway alignment following engine failure immediately after takeoff.", "Crashed into the Cameroon mountains after the wing separated due to severe turbulence.", "For reasons undetermined, the right engine failed and as a result of being overloaded, the aircraft did not maintain altitude on one engine and struck the ground with the right wingtip. A possible contributing factor was the failure of the co-pilot's vacuum-driven gyro instruments, without his knowledge.", "Crash landed in a sandstorm on the fourth landing attempt.  The plane came in too low, struck a line of trees and crashed 1,200 yards short of the runway.  Pilot error.  In an error in judgement, the captain who allowed his desire to keep the runway lights in view failed to make adequate reference to his flight instruments.", "The cargo plane lost 3 engines and ditched into the Pacific Ocean. The loss of power in three engines due to incorrect fuel system management and faulty restarting methods which resulted in the ditching of the aircraft.", "The cargo plane ditched into the Thoa river. The pilot radioed he was going down and was ditching into a lake. Fuel exhaustion.", "Crashed in adjacent mountains while attempting an emergency landing following an engine fire.", "The aircraft crashed into cloud covered Medicine Bow Peak while en route. The plane failed to clear the 12,013 ft. peak by 75 feet. The pilot deviated from course for reasons unknown.  Possible incapacitation of crew by carbon monoxide emanating from a faulty cabin heater, though never proven.", "Crashed into Kahlenberg Hill while on approach to Wien.  The aircraft flew for a longer time on the outbound track and descended below the prescribed minimum altitutde. Pilot error.", "The aircraft crashed 11 minutes after taking off from Denver Stapleton Airport, 8 miles east of Longmont.  Detonation of a dynamite bomb in the No. 4 cargo hold, placed by John (Jack) Gilbert Graham in his mother's luggage in order to collect $37,500 in insurance.  A delayed flight caused the bomb to detonate over flat land rather than the mountains as planned.  Graham never showed any remorse for his actions and refused to file any appeals. He was executed for the crime on 1/11/56.", "Crashed into the  peak of Mount Charleston 30 miles WNW of Las Vegas during a storm.", "Crashed on takeoff. In-flight prop failure.  Maintenance error.  The excessively high drag resulting from the improperly indexed propeller blades and inability to feather.", "The military transport crashed seconds after taking off from Central Airport in Iwo Jima. Malfunction of the number one engine propeller that went into reverse after an electrical short-circuit occurred.", "The aircraft crashed into a wooded area in 5 degree nose-down attitude.  Abnormal nose-down trim condition which could not be corrected due to an unknown malfunction.", "Shortly after taking off, the No.1 engine lost power. The crew shut off the hydraulic pump which caused the landing gear to stop retracting halfway. The resulting drag, caused the aircraft to lose altitude. The left wing struck a tree and the plane crashed and burned. Failure of the front bearing of the propeller shaft leading to disconnection of the reduction gear and left propeller and causing a sudden failure of the left engine.", "Flew into a mountain wave in the Sikhote-Alin Mountain Range while en route.", "The cargo plane was carrying mail . An in-flight structural failure resulting from a violent pitch-down induced by the erratic action of nonconforming elevator tab controls.", "Crashed on takeoff.", "The plane crashed while on approach and during an attempted go-around.  The crew allowed the aircraft to deviate to the left of course and descent below the glide path for reasons unknown.  The crew encountered local fog and restricted visibility during the final approach of an ILS approach and missed approach procedure came too late to prevent the aircraft from descending into the ground."]}
