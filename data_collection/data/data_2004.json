The crew declared an emergency but the plane did not make the airport, crashed and broke up. PC:  The pilots' unprofessional behavior, deviation from standard operating procedures, and poor airmanship, which resulted in an in-flight emergency from which they were unable to recover, in part because of the pilots' inadequate training The pilots' failure to prepare for an emergency landing in a timely manner, including communicating with air traffic controllers immediately after the emergency about the loss of both engines and the availability of landing sites and the pilots' failure to achieve and maintain the target airspeed in the double engine failure checklist, which caused the engine cores to stop rotating and resulted in the core lock engine condition. Contributing to this accident was the engine core lock condition, which prevented at least one engine from being restarted, and the airplane flight manuals that did not communicate to pilots the importance of maintaining a minimum airspeed to keep the engine cores rotating.", "During descent in poor weather, the cargo plane struck a mountain near the airport.", "A few minutes after takeoff, the cargo plane struck the side Tagbao mountain a few  kilometers from the airport.", "The turboprop crashed 4 miles south of Kirksville while on approach to Kirksville Municipal Airport. The plane clipped tree tops before crashing on its belly into a wooded area. Data show the plane descending then climbing slightly in the last four seconds before impact. The plane lacked a modern terrain warning system which would have been required equipment the next year. The pilots' failure to follow established procedures and properly conduct a nonprecision instrument approach at night in instrument meteorological conditions, including their descent below the minimum descent altitude before required visual cues were available (which continued unmoderated until the airplane struck the trees) and their failure to adhere to the established division of duties between the flying and nonflying pilots. Contributing to the accident were the pilots' failure to make standard callouts and the current Federal Aviation Regulations that allow pilots to descend below the MDA into a region in which safe obstacle clearance is not assured based upon seeing the airport approach lights. The pilots' failure to establish and maintain a professional demeanor during the flight and their fatigue likely contributed to their degraded performance.", "Two minutes after taking off, the air ambulance crashed into Otay peak,  in an isolated area of mountains, 8 miles east of Brown Field Municipal Airport. Dark night visual conditions prevailed. The controller's Minimum Safe Altitude Warning System issued and alert during the last two radar returns. The air traffic controller failed to alert the crew to altitude warnings as the plane was on track to fly into a mountain. The controller identified the airplane on the radar screen and instructed crew members to expect clearance above 5,000 feet, but then issued a heading that resulted in a flight track directly into the mountains. The mountain is at 3,556 feet altitude. Also, the flight crew did not follow the recommended departure procedures for taking off at night and in mountainous terrain. Failure of the flightcrew to maintain terrain clearance during a VFR departure, which resulted in controlled flight into terrain, and the air traffic controller's issuance of a clearance that transferred the responsibility for terrain clearance from the fllightcrew to the controller. The controller's failure to provide terrain clearance instructions to the flightcrew, and failure to advise the flightcrew of minimum safe altitude warning alerts. Contributing to the accident was the pilots' fatigue which likely contributed to their degraded decision making.", "The plane struck a steep incline in the Bull Mountain area seven miles from the Blue Ridge Regional Airport in heavy fog. Wreckage was confined to an area of approximately 200 ft. long. Killed in the crash were members of the Hendrick Motorsports racing team including the son, brother and two nieces of owner Rick Hendrick. Failure of the crew to properly execute the published instrument approach procedure. A contributing cause was the crew's failure to use all navigational aids to confirm and monitor their position during the approach.", "The aircraft was arriving on runway 09 at Simon Bolivar Airport when it departed the right side of the runway and cashed into the airport fire house. Weather at the time of the accident was poor, with low ceiling and torrential rain.", "The aircraft crashed into a frozen lake in Nanhai Park, 10 seconds after taking off. Ice pollution of the wings of the aircraft led to the accident. Failure to deice the plane.", "While on final approach, the aircraft struck a light pole located 1.5 mile short of Runway 04 in thick fog and crashed in a nearby field. The flight crew's failure to adequately monitor and cross check the flight instruments during the approach. Contributing to the accident was the flight crew's failure to select the instrument landing system frequency in a timely manner and to adhere to approved company approach procedures, including the stabilized approach criteria.", "Crashed into a mountain 80 miles west of Bagram while en route. The wreckage site was located a the 14,000 ft. level of a 16,739 ft. mountain. The crew deliberately avoided the standard route and took a joy ride in another direction, eventually becoming trapped in a canyon and slamming into a mountainside.", "While attempting to take off from R31, the aircraft skidded sideways off the runway and went through a perimeter fence, ripping the cockpit from the fuselage and bursting into flames. There was light snow falling with fog and reduced visibility at the time of the accident.  Also, the pilot chose to take off from a 7,500 ft. runway rather than wait for the 10,000 ft. runway to be plowed. The youngest son of NBC sports chairman Dick Ebersol and actress Susan Saint James killed. St. James had just exited the accident vehicle before it took off. The flightcrew's failure to ensure that the airplane's wings were free of ice or snow contamination that accumulated while the airplane was on the ground, which resulted in an attempted takeoff with upper wing contamination that induced the a subsequent stall and collision with the ground. A factor contributing to the accident was the pilots' lack of experience flying during winter weather conditions.", "While attempting to land, the plane overran the runway and crashed through the airport barrier fence, into a rice field, broke in two and  came to rest at a cemetery, 300 meters beyond the runway. Bad weather and a malfunctioning spoiler may have caused the crash.", "Crashed while en route in mountainous terrain.", "A forward emergency exit opened in flight causing one of the crew members to be sucked out. An emergency landing was made in Jeddah.", "The crew was performing a mail flight under Total Linhas A\u00e9reas from Sao Paulo-Guarulhos airport to Uberaba. While on final approach at night, the cargo plane crashed into houses located short of runway and burned."]}
