There was light snow and 1.5 miles visibility at the time of the accident. Two members and six staffers of the Oklahoma State University basketball team were among those killed.

Heavy rain and wind were present in the area at the time of the accident. Weight imbalances in the aircraft were the primary cause of the accident as the cargo shifted when the pilot  got up and walked through the plane toward the rear of the plane, unbalancing the aircraft just as it hit severe turbulence. This led to the loss of control and break-up of the aircraft.", "The aircraft exploded and caught fire 35 minutes before its scheduled takeoff. Five members of the cabin crew were the only people aboard the plane at the time. Witnesses said they heard an explosion before flames erupted aboard the aircraft. NTSB investigators reported that the center fuel tank exploded followed by the right tank 18 minutes later. The cause for the explosion was unclear.

The first officer was flying the plane, when at 2,600 ft., an audible alarm sounded indicating a wide angle of attack. Eleven seconds later the aircraft swung around 180 degrees and entered a flat spin. The captain ordered the engines at full throttle but it was too late and 22 seconds later the plane hit the ground, belly first, broke up and burned.\u00a0Incorrect actions of the crew. Due to poor communication between pilots, they put in the wrong parameters while landing causing the plane to descend at the wrong angle. As a result, the plane stalled and entered a spin and crashed.", "After several delays in taking off, the helicopter crashed into the sea, just off shore, after striking a electric transmission tower.

The aircraft was returning to McCarran International Airport where it had originated. Besides the pilot, all victims, including the one survivor, were members of the same family. The pilot's decision to maneuver the helicopter in a flight regime and in a high density altitude environment which significantly decreased the helicopter's performance capabilities, resulting in a high rate of descent from which recovery was not possible. Factors contributing to the accident were high density altitude and the pilot's decision to maneuver the helicopter in proximity to precipitous terrain, which effectively limited remedial options available.", "After an engine failed the crew declared an emergency and elected to divert to Bukavu but crashed 10 km short of the airport.", "Shortly after taking off the cargo plane crashed into a wooded area about one-half mile from the runway.

Factors in the accident were the low visibility and cloud conditions, and the dark night.", "The crew reported that they had a loss of fuel and were going to have to divert to Lajes AFB. Shortly thereafter, they said that they only had five minutes of fuel and probably would not reach Lajes. The Airbus 330, without engine power, glided for almost 20 minutes, descending from for more than 30,000 ft. before landing safely at Lajes Airport. Several tires blew out causing a fire which was quickly extinguished by emergency crews.  Eleven passengers were slightly injured. The leak was caused by a damaged fuel feed pipe that was caused by interference from the aft hydraulic pump. Mechanics did not completely follow a Rolls-Royce service bulletin. In addition, software mistakenly identified the  fuel leak as a fuel imbalance, prompting the crew to respond erroneously to the situation. The official report stated the cause was the pilots responded incorrectly to the fuel leak.  The pilots acted from memory rather than utilizing a checklist, so they never saw a \"Caution\" note in the Fuel Imbalance checklist that might have caused them to consider that the real problem was not an imbalance but a fuel leak.", "The aircraft crash-landed on a highway near Ruiz Picasso Airport in M\u00e1laga. While on final approach, the pilot reported failure of the plane's left engine forcing the crew to make an emergency landing.  The plane crashed 1,300 ft. short of the runway.

The airliner was brought down accidentally by a Ukrainian surface-to-air missile, fired during military exercises.", "The seaplane crashed into Mollet Lake while attempting to land. The seaplane stalled at an altitude that did not allow the pilot time to recover from the stall. The stall occurred in circumstances conducive to illusions created by drift.", "The MD-87 aircraft was taking off from Linate Airport in fog and poor visibility when it struck a German Cessna Citation II business jet. The MD-87 rotated for takeoff and did make it into the air for 9 seconds, but was too damaged to sustain flight. The plane then swerved off the runway and  collided with the airport's baggage handling building, bursting into flames. The Cessna,  which was about to take off for Paris, entered the active runway by mistake, after  having been told by the tower to enter a different taxiway and hold short of the runway. One hundred four passengers and 6 crew on the MD-87 and  2 passengers and 2 crew on the Citation were killed along with 4 on the ground. The MD-87 was named Lage Viking.  Caused largely by human error and poorly followed safety procedures and improper terminology used by the tower. Communication between the aircraft and the tower had been \"in English and Italian,\" as opposed to aviation standards that only English be spoken. In addition, despite the poor visibility and inadequately marked airport landmarks, the control tower operators failed to ask the Cessna to read back his instructions to make sure they were understood. There was no ground radar, runway motion sensors were turned off and it took 20 minutes before anyone realized the two planes had collided.", "The plane was en-route from Barcelona, Spain to Oran, Algeria, 80 miles off the coast of Valencia, Spain when it informed Valencia ATC it was going to change course in order to avoid bad weather. There was no further contact with the aircraft. Debris was sighted two days later on the water. Electrical power was presumably lost following a lightning strike. Control was lost and the airplane crashed into the sea.", "Shortly after taking off from Dillingham, the aircraft's wing dipped, the nose pitched up, the plane became inverted and crashed to the ground. The weather was clear and windy at the time of the accident. An in-flight loss of control resulting from upper surface ice contamination that the pilot-in-command failed to detect during his preflight inspection of the airplane. Contributing to the accident was the lack of a preflight inspection requirement for CE-208 pilots to examine at close range the upper surface of the wing for ice contamination when ground icing conditions exist.", "The air ambulance was flown into terrain during an overshoot because the required climb angle was not set and maintained to ensure a positive rate of climb. During the go-around, conditions were present for somatogravic illusion, which most likely led to the captain losing situational awareness.", "The helicopter was flying very low because the pilot was not instrument rated. The skid hit the water followed by the tail rotor and the helicopter crashed. The pilot's failure to maintain clearance from the surface of an open body of water while intentionally attempting to maintain a very low altitude while in cruise flight. Factors include falling snow, low ceilings, whiteout/greyout conditions, and flat/glassy water.", "Three minutes after taking off and while in a climbing left turn, at 2,800 ft., parts of the plane, including the vertical stabilizer and rudder, fell from the aircraft. The crew soon lost control of the plane which nose dived and crashed into a residential neighborhood. After flying into the wake turbulence of two aircraft about two minutes into the flight, investigators believe a series of quick rudder swings by the copilot whipped the tail so severely that the fin broke off. The National Transportation Safety Board has found that pilot error was the probable cause. Sharply criticizing American Airlines Advanced Aircraft Maneuvering Program, the Board said that American Airlines' pilot training included a simulator exercise which could have caused the first officer to have an unrealistic and exaggerated view of the effects of wake turbulence, erroneously associate wake turbulence encounters with the need for aggressive roll upset recovery techniques and develop control strategies that would produce a much different -- and potentially surprising and confusing -- response if performed during flight. In addition, because of its high sensitivity, the Airbus A-300-600 rudder control system is susceptible to potentially hazardous rudder pedal inputs at higher airspeed.", "Residents heard a loud noise and saw flames in the night sky as the aircraft clipped treetops and summer homes before crashing into a snowy forest. Wreckage was spread over a 1.5 mile area. Serious maintenance violations and operational procedures were discovered during the investigation of the accident.", "The cargo plane was not able to gain altitude, veered off the runway and crashed. The (undetermined) pilot-at-the-controls' early, and over rotation of the airplane's nose during the takeoff attempt, and his failure to maintain directional control. Also causal, was the captain's inadequate remedial action, both during the takeoff attempt and after the airplane departed the runway.", "The plane crashed into a marshy forested area about 2 kilometer short of its destination at Kardla Airport. Several errors by the pilot.", "The aircraft was flying through a mix of rain and snow on final approach, when it crashed in a wooded area, 5.5 miles from Zurich Airport where it was scheduled to land on Runway 28.  At 22.03 the aircraft was descending to 4000 ft. on final approach.  At 22.05 the captain reported reaching the minimum descent altitude and stated he could see the ground. Shortly after, the radio altimeter reported 500 ft. agl, followed by a \"minimum\" warning. A go-around was ordered, but it was too late and the aircraft struck trees and crashed. American pop singer, Melanie Thornton, 34, killed. Maria Serano Serano and Nathaly van het Ende both 27, and members of the pop-music trio, Passion Fruit, also killed. The pilot had been working more than 13 hours when the accident took place and had also exceeded maximum duty several times in the days preceding the crash. A controlled flight into terrain caused by the captain deliberately descending below the minimum descent altitude without having the required visual contact with either the approach lights or the runway and the copilot making no attempt to prevent the continuation of the flight below the minimum descent altitude. The report revealed that the pilot had failed to perform correct navigation and landing procedures before, but no action had been taken by the airline.  The range of hills the plane crashed into was not marked in the Jeppesen approach chart used by the crew, despite the hilly terrain the approach to runway 28 was not equipped with a minimum safe altitude warning (MSAW) system, which triggers an alarm if a minimum safe altitude is violated, and the airport's means of determining visibility were inadequate for runway 28 and the visual minimums at the time of the accident were actually inappropriate for using the standard approach to runway 28.", "The cargo plane contacted the ground 700 meters short of the runway, broke in two and burned.", "A fire broke out aboard the aircraft while en route at FL290. The crew was preparing for an emergency landing when two explosions tore apart the plane causing it to crash.", "The plane may have been shot down by Allied Democratic Forces rebels.", "The aircraft crashed into El Silencio de El manzanillo mountain at 7,800 ft., 3 minutes after taking off in heavy rain and poor visibility from Medellin Airport.", " The aircraft crashed into the Weser River shortly after taking off from Bremerhaven Airport.
