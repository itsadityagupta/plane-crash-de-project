Wreckage was found 5 miles south of Parepare. The accident was caused by the autopilot being accidentally disconnected. The two pilots had been trying to fix a problem with the plane's navigation instruments when they disconnected the autopilot and lost control of the plane. Without the autopilot, the plane went out of control, listing to the right and pitching down. The IRS navigation system was repeatedly reported malfunctioning but was never repaired. This is what initially distracted the crew.", "The cargo plane crashed in fog while attempting to land for a second time at Balad Air Base.

The cockpit voice recorder revealed that the pilot and co-pilot were arguing over their speed and wing flap angles moments before the crash. An investigator stated the passenger jet was flying at up to 265 mph, almost double the normal landing speed, while attempting to land. The captain ignored the plane\u0092s automated warning system as it sounded alarms fifteen times. He also ignored calls from the co-pilot to go around and make another approach.", "The helicopter crashed on Kauai shortly after the pilot radioed that he was having problems with the hydraulics. The helicopter hit the ground about 200 yards from it's normal landing pad. The failure of maintenance personnel to properly tighten (torque) the flight control servo lower attachment clevis, and reinstall a functioning lock washer, which resulted in a flight control disconnect and a complete loss of helicopter control. Contributing to the accident was the operator's failure to ensure its maintenance program was being executed in accordance with Federal regulations.", "The helicopter was flying low near the coast when there was a loud bang and parts, including the tail rotor, fell into the ocean. The helicopter then hit trees and a fence as it spiraled down into an open field. The fatigue failure of the tail rotor blade root fitting due to a manufacturing defect which resulted in the separation of the tail rotor system and loss of tail rotor control. A contributing factor to the accident were the trees that the helicopter struck during the autorotation.", "Fifteen minutes before arriving at its destination  the crew informed ATC about a technical problem and that they were losing altitude. Few minutes  later, the twin engine plane crashed into an open field.", "While attempting to land in heavy fog, the airplane contacted the ground 400 m short of the runway. The left wing hit the ground and separated from the fuselage. The plane then rolled over inverted and the fuselage broke apart. The accident can be blamed on both the controller, who did not inform the pilot about the reduced visibility in time due to organizational problems, and on the pilot, who did not give the dispatcher the correct information about his landing trajectory and, consequently, did not decide to stop the landing procedure and try to take another approach at the time he should have done so.", "The cargo plane, carrying African peacekeepers, was struck by an anti-aircraft missile shortly after taking off from Mogadishu Airport. The aircraft lost a wing into the Indian Ocean and shortly thereafter crashed in the eastern outskirts of Mogadishu.", "The plane landed at Kato and could not take off because of bad weather.

Conflicting reports say the helicopter may have been shot down by Chechnyan rebels.", "The plane crashed in a dense, swampy forested area, 5 km from Douala Airport, moments after taking off in stormy weather. The plane was just six months old.  After take off, the plane was banking right and the pilot did not notice the inclination, but when he did, he banked the craft further right. The pilot released the flight controls for nearly one minute without engaging the auto pilot, which could have corrected the banking angle, then at 34 degrees. However, his intervention worsened the tilt. The captain grabed the controls, appeared confused about the attitude of the airplane and made corrections in an erratic manner increasing the banking angle to 50 degrees. When the bank angle increased to 70 degrees, the captain stated \"we are crashing.\" The first officer told him to level the aircraft, but quickly corrected himself and said \"left, left, left captain. The aircraft  then plunged nose down into a mangrove swamp.", "Collided with a truck while attempting to make an emergency landing on a road.

It was shuttling passengers between Sierra Leone's coastal capital of Freetown and Lungi Airport.", "The pilot issued a distress signal within five minutes of taking off from General Mitchell International Airport in Milwaukee, requesting an emergency return to the airport. The plane then crashed into Lake Michigan two miles off shore. The plane was carrying an organ transplant team. The pilot reported to ATC he had runaway trim prior to the accident. The pilot's mismanagement of an abnormal flight control situation through improper actions including lack of crew coordination and failing to control airspeed and to prioritize control of the airplane. The event was controllable if the captain had not allowed the airspeed and resulting control forces to increase while he tried to troubleshoot the problem. By allowing their airplane's speed to increase while engaging in poorly coordinated troubleshooting efforts, the pilots allowed and abnormal situation to escalate to an emergency.", "While en route to a forest fire, the helicopter crashed into dense forest on a mountain at an altitude of 6,100 feet.", "The plane crashed shortly after taking off into a swamp coming to rest upside down.

One passenger was killed.", "The jet airliner crashed while attempting to land in heavy rain at Congonhas airport. The plane skidded off the end of the runway across a major roadway and struck a gas station and building, bursting into flames.  The right engine had a malfunctioning reverser. In this situation, the correct procedure was for the pilot to retard both throttles to idle and then advance both throttles to reverse, as if he had no problem with the reversers. The former procedure, which was changed by Airbus, was to take both throttles to idle, and then advance just the throttle corresponding to the engine with the operating reverser. It was changed by Airbus because there had been several incidents where the pilot forgot to bring both throttles back to idle, leaving one engine reversed and the other thrusting forward. The downside to this change was it would lengthen the stopping distance. The pilot was so concerned about the short and slippery runway that he chose to switch to the old procedure and got it wrong. A contributing factor was the heavy rain and wind and the fact that the newly resurfaced runway had not had grooves installed yet.", "The cargo plane crashed shortly after taking off after an engine failed. The pilot was trying to return for an emergency landing.", "The single engine aircraft crashed onto a heavily forested mountain, 30 miles east of Ketchican while on a sightseeing trip over Misty Fiords. The pilot's decision to continue under visual flight rules into an area of instrument meteorological conditions. Contributing to the accident was the pilot's inadequate weather evaluation and the FAA's inadequate surveillance of the commercial air tour operator.", "The cargo plane, carrying 9 tons of cargo, crashed 4 km from the runway as it was attempting to take off from Domodedovo airport. The aircraft slammed into a field shattering debris over a wide area.", "Soon after taking off the plane began loosing altitude and veered to the right until it crashed into the sea 1 mile beyond the runway. Loss of pitch control of the aircraft following a break in an elevator cable.", "The float plane crashed on land into a tree, 200 feet from shore, while attempting to land. High winds were in the area at the time of the accident. The  pilot's poor decision-making and inadequate planning. To avoid the rising waves, the pilot decided to take off toward the sheltered interior of the bay, toward the rising terrain, in a direction he had never attempted before. As the pilot attempted to turn the aircraft around, the airplane hit a downdraft, which held it from climbing above the closing landscape and caused the plane to stall about 60 feet over the ground.", "After a normal landing, the slats were retracted,and the mechanism came to rest as usual against the fuel tank.  On the right wing, a stop bolt that had come loose was pushed into the tank, breaching it.  The leaking fuel blew away during taxi, but once the plane stopped at the terminal, it spilled straight down and ignited from the engine's hot tailpipe. Everyone was able to evacuate but the plane was destroyed.  Boeing, aware of this failure mode due to past incidents, had ordered the nut at the end of the stop bolt to be glued on but to do this, the maintenance technician had to work awkwardly by feel and had inadvertently lost the associated washer that actually retained the bolt in place.", "Crashed shortly after taking off from Curitiba", "Crashed most likely due to a mechanical problem while traveling with a second helicopter.", "The cargo plane, carrying tin ore, lost one of it's two engines eleven minutes after taking off and tried to return to the airport. Due to strong back winds and a fully loaded plane, the aircraft clipped tree tops and crashed and burned 3 km short of the runway. The plane was overloaded by 3 tons.", "The cargo plane, carrying palm oil, overshot the runway, crashed into a petrified lava flow and caught fire.", "While landing in heavy rain and strong cross winds, the aircraft skidded off the runway, struck an earth embankment and caught fire.
