Pilot error, pilots of both aircraft.", "The first takeoff attempt ended in an aborted takeoff due to engine boosting. This was not uncommon with this type of aircraft at higher altitudes and was usually caused the thrust being opened too fast. The second attempt to take off was aborted for the same reason. During the third attempt, as the plane passed V1 (committed to take off) the plane suddenly decelerated, never became airborne, crashed through the barrier fence, into a house and burst into flames. Eight members of the Manchester United football (soccer) team killed. A German inquiry concluded at an accumulation of ice on the wings was the cause of the accident, blaming the captain for not deicing the plane. Ten years later the British reopened the inquiry and concluded the accident was caused by slush on the last quarter of the runway. The reason other planes had taken off without incident was because they lifted in the air using only two thirds of the runway. The accident plane, because of the engine boosting, went further down the runway to take off.

Both trainee and instructor aboard the F-100 were killed along with all forty-seven aboard the DC-7 airliner. A high rate of near head-on closure at high altitude,  Human and cockpit limitations and the failure of Nellis Air Force Base and the Civil Aeronautics Administration to take measures to reduce a known collision exposure as training exercises were allowed to be conducted within the confines of several airways after numerous close calls with military jets had been reported by airline crews for more than a year prior to the tragedy.", "Crashed shortly after taking off.

The approach was within tolerances and normal until after passing through GCA minimums, at which time the aircraft went below glide path and the pilot was instructed to take a waveoff. The waveoff was not executed until after the aircraft had actually made contact with the runway. After climbout, GCA was contacted and a second approach was requested to commence with no delay. The pilot advised GCA that the runway was in sight just before GCA gave him a waveoff on the first approach. The second approach was again normal until the final controller gave the instructions, \"Approaching GCA minimums.\" The aircraft immediately commenced dropping below glide path.
