the airport in light rain. After departing, the captain turned the aircraft to the right instead of to the left. The first officer advised the captain he should be turning left and ATC also asked about the direction taken. ATC then cleared the aircraft for a right turn. Soon after, the pitch decreased rapidly accompanied by a marked speed increase and plane entered a high speed, high-rate, spiral descent and crashed into an open field. The flight crew reacted inappropriately to the change in departure clearance SID ZUE 1Y by ATC. The first officer made an entry in the FMS, without being instructed to do so by the commander, which related to the change to the SID ZUE 1 standard instrument departure. In doing so, he omitted to select a turn direction. The captain dispensed with use of the autopilot under instrument flight conditions and during the work-intensive climb phase of the flight. The captain took the aircraft into a spiral dive to the right because, with a probability bordering on certainty, he had lost spatial orientation. The first officer took only inadequate measures to prevent or recover from the spiral dive. The commander was not systematically acquainted by Crossair with the specific features of western systems and cockpit procedures. Specifically both pilots  had trained in the Soviet Union, where the attitude indicator works differently. Theirs show an icon of the airplane changing position in front of a fixed horizon, mimicking what an observer outside the plane would see if there was daylight; but western type indicators show a fixed airplane icon and an artificial horizon changing position, mimicking what the pilot would see.  Consequently the diagonal line on the display is angled the same way for a right turn on one type as for a left turn on the other type.", "The aircraft was on a flight from Tripoli to Marsa el-Brega Libya ferrying oil workers. As the twin engine plane approached Marsa El-Brega, the crew experienced a double engine failure and ditched into the sea. Failure of the crew to use the anti-icing system which led to the ingestion of melting ice into both engines causing failure of both engines.", "The aircraft was not able to maintain altitude after taking off and crashed into a house. The aircraft was overloaded. Lack of safety instruction to passengers. Flaps not properly selected. Took off without clearance.", "The aircraft crashed into the Atlantic Ocean three minutes after taking off from Felix Houphouet-Boigny Airport.  A few seconds after lifting off the ground the stall warning sounded and continued for about 20 seconds until it was manually turned off by the crew. Three seconds later the plane impacted the water. The pilot's response to an alarm that inaccurately indicated the plane had stalled. The pilot failed to complete established procedure for such an emergency. Takeoff conditions also contributed to the accident, which occurred at night, hampering the crew's ability to judge the plane's distance from the sea.", "The aircraft crashed into the Pacific Ocean south of Point Mugu in 650 ft. feet of water while en route from Puerto Vallarta to San Francisco. Radio transmissions from the plane indicated the pilots were struggling with a jammed stabilizer for the last 11 minutes of the flight before nose-diving into the sea. While preparing to make an emergency landing at Los Angeles International Airport control was lost and the MD-83 was seen in a nose-down attitude, spinning and tumbling in a continuous roll, inverted, before it impacted the sea.  Loss of airplane pitch control resulting from in-flight failure of the horizontal stabilizer trim system jackscrew assembly's acme nut thread. The component failed because of excessive wear resulting from Alaska Airlines' insufficient lubrication of the jackscrew assembly. Contributing to the accident were Alaska Airlines' extended lubrication interval and the Federal Aviation Administration's approval of that extension, which increased the likelihood that a missed or inadequate lubrication would result in excessive wear of the acme nut threads and Alaska Airlines' extended end play check interval and the FAA's approval of that extension, which allowed the excessive wear of the acme nut threads to progress to failure without the opportunity for detection. Also contributing to the accident was the absence on the McDonnell Douglas MD-80 of a fail-safe mechanism to prevent the catastrophic effects of total acme nut thread loss. Cynthia Oti, radio financial talk show host, Dean Forshee, guitarist, Jean Gandesberry, columnist, Tom Stockley, columnist were among those killed.", "Crashed on take off.", "The cargo plane lost altitude after taking off and crashed into a auto salvage yard and burned. A loss of pitch control resulting from the disconnection of the right elevator control tab. The disconnection was caused by the failure to properly secure and inspect the attachment bolt.", "While attempting to land at Burbank Airport, the plane overran the runway, collided with a metal blast fence and an airport perimeter wall and came to rest on a city street near a gas station. The plane touched down at 182 knots, 2,150 feet past the runway threshold, too fast and too far down the runway for the plane to stop in time.  In the accident sequence,  the nose gear collapsed, the forward service door (1R) escape slide inflated inside the airplane and  the forward dual flight attendant jumpseat, which was occupied by two flight attendants, partially collapsed. Two passengers sustained serious injuries and 41 passengers and the captain sustained minor injuries. The flightcrew's excessive airspeed and flight path angle during the approach and landing and its failure to abort the approach when stabilized approach criteria were not met. Contributing to the accident was the controller's positioning of the airplane in such a manner as to leave no safe options for the flightcrew other than a go-around maneuver.", "The aircraft climbed to an altitude of about 100 ft., stalled, lost control and crashed. Ice build up on the wings. Flaps incorrectly set.", "Crashed into a jungle mountainside 15 miles short of its destination while en route. The wreckage was found at the 2,500 ft. level of a 2,790 ft. mountain.  Weather was poor at the time.", "After lifting off the cargo plane entered a steep, nose-up attitude, banked to the left, and crashed. The pilot lost control of the aircraft while conducting a go-around from a aborted landing on the ice strip.  The aircraft's center of gravity on the accident flight was beyond the aft C of G limit. The crew did not recalculate the aircraft's weight and balance for the second flight. Leaks in the heater shroud allowed carbon monoxide gas to contaminate cockpit and cabin air.", "Crashed while attempting to land in poor weather.", "The pilot -in-command made two requests to land because he was low on fuel. While attempting to land, he ran out of fuel and crashed short of the runway. The Cargo plane broke into four parts and crashed into houses.", "The aircraft, leased from a Ukrainian company, overran they runway and crashed into a ditch after an aborted takeoff. Brake failure as the pilot attempted to avoid a hole in the runway.", "The crew reported engine trouble 10 minutes before it crashed while en route. Members of the Liberation Tigers confessed to firing missiles at the plane.", "While on finals the training flight pitched up, the right wing dropped, and the airplane struck trees, struck wires, caught fire on a road. The pilot's failure to maintain control of the airplane while on final approach resulting in the airplane striking trees. Factors in this accident were: improper planning of the approach, and not obtaining the proper alignment with the runway.", "The aircraft circled Davao airport in an attempt to land but crashed onto a coconut plantation on the mountainous Samal Island. The plane aborted a previous landing attempt because another plane was on the runway. Weather and visibility were good in the area but the landing attempt may have been hampered by low-lying clouds. The last message from the crew was that they were 7 miles from the airport on final approach. Nothing more was heard from the plane. The aircraft disintegrated upon impact near Mt. Kalangan. The elevation of the accident site was about 500 feet above sea level but the plane should have been at a altitude of 1,500 feet.", "The military flight crashed after losing its engines after striking birds,unable to return to land.", "While taking off the plane struck trees at the end of the runway, crashed and burned.", "During a landing attempt the crew shut down No. 1 engine and declared an emergency. The plane was told to divert to Lyon Satolas. Power was applied to the remaining engine and the plane banked to the left causing the wing to touch the ground, crash and catch fire. Loss of yaw and roll control which appears to be due to the failure to monitor flight symmetry at the time of the thrust increase on the right engine.", "The cargo plane crashed into a cloud covered mountain.", "While on approach the charter flight hit the ridge of a mountain. Inadequate crew coordination led to the captain's decision to discontinue the instrument approach procedure and initiate a maneuvering descent solely by visual references at night in an area of mountainous terrain. The crew failed to review the instrument approach procedure and the copilot failed to provide accurate information regarding terrain clearance and let down procedures during the instrument approach.", "The charter flight crashed while on approach in fog and mist.", "The plane crashed into a heavily wood area  as it was making a second approach to Wilkes-Barre/Scranton International Airport. Visibility was poor in wind, low clouds and light rain.  While attempting the second approach, the pilot reported both engines had quit but restarted one of them before the plane crashed. Investigation revealed indications of rotation on the left engine at the time of impact but the power level was not known. The right engine and propellers exhibited little or no rotation at the time of impact. Failure of the crew to ensure an adequate supply of fuel for the flight, which led to the stoppage of the right engine due to fuel exhaustion and the intermittent stoppage of the left engine.  Failure of the crew to monitor the plane's fuel state and the flightcrews failure to maintain directional control after the initial stoppage.", "A hijacker robbed passengers, jumped out of the plane with a homemade parachute and was killed in the jump.", "En route and descending at Whyalla,  at 6,000 ft., the pilot transmitted a MAYDAY, reporting that both engines of the aircraft had failed, that there were eight persons on board and that he was going to have to ditch the aircraft, but was trying to reach Whyalla. Three minutes later he reported his position 15 nm off the coast of Whyalla. No further transmissions were heard from the plane and the wreckage was found in Spencer Gulf the next morning. Malfunction of both engines due to the failure of components of the engines. A fractured connecting rod in the left engine led the pilot to increase the power setting in the right engine, leading to the No. 6 piston being holed in the right engine.", "The plane made a hard landing, short of the runway and broke in two during a heavy rainstorm.", "The plane was attempting to land at Whuan's Wanjiatun Airport in thunderstorms and heavy rain when it was struck by lightning causing it to explode and crash.

However, he overshot the runway and crashed into the sea. One passenger was rescued by fishermen. Major General Santiago Madrid, chief of the southwestern military command, killed.", "The plane crashed into a heavily forested area 42 miles southeast of Villahermosa. There was fog and rain in the area  at the time.  Flying VFR, deviation to avoid weather resulted in spatial disorientation of the crew which led to descending below a safe flying altitude to clear high ground.", "The cargo plane had 19 people aboard when it crashed into a farm after losing the No. 2 engine, two minutes after taking off from Villavicencio.", "The plane, on a positioning flight crashed into rugged woods during an approach to land. The pilot's continued VFR flight into IMC conditions, by failing to maintain altitude, and descending from VFR conditions into IMC, which resulted in him subsequently impacting with trees. Factors in this accident were: reduced visibility due to dark night and fog. An additional factor was the pilot was not certified for instrument flight.", "While attempting to land at Patna, the aircraft was too high and the crew attempted a go-around. During the second landing attempt, the aircraft was again high, veered to left and lost altitude until it crashed into houses in the Gardanibagh district and burst into flames. The cause of the accident was loss of control of the aircraft due to crew error. The crew did not followed the correct approach procedure, which resulted in the aircraft being high on approach. The crew then initiated a \"go-around procedure\" instead of an \"approach to stall recovery procedure\" resulting in an actual stall of the aircraft, loss of control and subsequent impact with the ground.", "After declaring an emergency the cargo plane crew requested the nearest airport. The aircraft soon after descended out of control and crashed on the eastern side of the Meduxnekeag River. The pilot-in-command's failure to maintain minimum control airspeed, which resulted in a loss of control.

The pilot reported the No. 2 engine failed and struggled to steer towards Le Bourget airfield as smoke and fire trailed the jet's left wing.   The plane was unable to gain altitude, went nose high, stalled and crashed into a small hotel complex.  A metal strip left on the runway by another plane gashed one of the Concorde's tires which blew out sending a piece of rubber into the underside of the wing which sent a shockwave which ruptured a seam in the fuel tank. An electrical severed by another piece of rubber sparked which ignited leaking fuel ignited and started an uncontrollable fire. Power was lost to the No. 1 and No. 2 engines which led to loss of control of the aircraft and subsequent crash. Investigation revealed the metal strip was probably a thrust reverser part from Continental Airlines DC-10-30 , registered N13067 which departed Paris as Flight 055 to Newark. This is the first crash of a Concorde in aviation history. The French government convicted Continental and a Continental mechanic of a crime but an appeals court reversed the decision.", "Crashed on a training flight.", "The aircraft crashed into the Churia mountain range at 4,300 ft., 20 minutes into a 30 minute flight to Dhangadhi in rain and fog.", "The helicopter exploded and crashed from a height of 1,000 ft.", "The aircraft crashed into a volcano after the pilot reported he was diverting to Puerto Montt because of ice formation on the wings.

Failure of the pilots of the two airplanes to see and avoid each other and maintain proper airspace separation during visual flight rules.", "The plane was approaching Tshikapa and the pilot informed the tower that it was having difficulties with its landing gear. The tower told the pilot to do a low fly-by for an evaluation and then make an emergency landing but the pilot refused and attempted to return to Kinshasa. The plane crashed 40 miles north of Tshikapa.", "The aircraft crashed into the Persian Gulf and exploded in flames while attempting to land at Bahrain International Airport. The crew decided to perform a missed approach after it was determined the aircraft was coming in too high and fast. Instructions were given for a 180 degree turn and climb to 2,500 feet. While performing the missed approach the plane suddenly descended rapidly from an altitude of 1,000 feet and crashed into the shallow waters of the gulf approximately 1 mile from the airport. The accident was a result of a fatal combination of factors, including the captain's failure to comply with standard operating procedures and the copilot's actions in not drawing the captain's attention to the deviations of the aircraft from the standard flight parameters. The captain may have suffered a \"spatial disorientation\" to ground warning systems, which could have made him falsely perceive the aircraft was pitching up. He responded by making a nose down input, resulting in the aircraft starting to descend, when aircraft warning systems were saying he should increase altitude.", "Flew into Mt. Montezuma.", "Shortly after departing Perth and after the aircraft had climbed through its assigned altitude, the pilot\u0092s speech became significantly impaired and he appeared unable to respond to ATS instructions. Open microphone transmissions over the next 8-minutes revealed the progressive deterioration of the pilot towards unconsciousness and the absence of any sounds of passenger activity in the aircraft. No human response of any kind was detected for the remainder of the flight. Five hours after taking off from Perth, the aircraft impacted the ground 65 km ESE of Burketown, Queensland, and was destroyed. Incapacitation of the pilot and passengers a result of hypobaric hypoxia due to the aircraft being fully or partially unpressurised and their not receiving supplemental oxygen. The investigation could not determine the reason for the aircraft being unpressurised, or why the pilot and passengers did not receive supplemental oxygen.", "The Air Force helicopter was on a domestic flight when it cashed into mountainous terrain 75 km from Colombo.

No passengers were killed aboard the aircraft but four people were killed on the ground.", "The chartered cargo plane hit tree tops and discintegrated while attempting to land. Although the pilot and the aircraft were certified for instrument flight, the pilot apparently continued to fly in accordance with visual flight rules after encountering marginal weather conditions and reduced visibility. For undetermined reasons, the pilot descended below the elevation of the terrain surrounding the airstrip, resulting in a controlled-flight-into-terrain accident.", "The cause of this accident was the pilot's excessive takeoff rotation, during an aft center of gravity takeoff, a rearward migration of fuel during acceleration and takeoff and consequent shift in the airplane's aft c.g. to aft of the aft c.g. limit, which caused the airplane to stall at an altitude too low for recovery. Contributing to the accident were Bombardier's inadequate flight planning procedures for the Challenger flight test program and the lack of direct, on-site operational oversight by Transport Canada and the Federal Aviation Administration.", "The twin engine Cessna crashed into a densely wooded area, 30 miles south of St. Louis, 25 minutes after taking off from Parks Airport.

Error by the Batumi ATC who failed to locate the plane and conform it to the crew. Erroneous data shown by ground radio-technical facilities at Batumi airport.", "Weather conditions at the time were extremely poor due to typhoon Xiang Sane. A NOTAM issued on Aug 31, 2000 indicated that Runway 05R was closed due to construction between Sep 13 and Nov 22. After reaching the end of Taxiway NP, the plane turned onto Taxiway N1 and then made a 180-degree turn onto Runway 05R and began its takeoff roll. Approximately 3.5 seconds after reaching V1, the aircraft hit construction equipment on the runway, crashed back to the ground, broke up and burst into flames. The pilot attempted to take off from a closed runway. The following factors contributed to the accident. Of three lights used to guide the aircraft onto the correct runway, one was not working and another dim. The airport lacked \"guard lights\" used to help pilots navigate from the taxiway to the correct runway during times of poor visibility. International regulations require that a large white X be placed on the tarmac at the entrance to a closed runway, but there was none at the entrance of runway 5R. Whether there should have been, in this case, however, is itself a contentious matter as the runway remained open for taxiing.", "The aircraft exploded in midair 20 minutes after taking off from Saurimo.
