Breakup of the No.2 engine starter, damaging fuel and oil lines and causing a fire.", "The aircraft stalled 1.2 miles east of runway 28L during an ILS approach. An aerodynamic stall occurred when the flightcrew allowed the airspeed to decay to stall speed following a poorly planned and executed approach characterized by an absence of procedural discipline. Improper pilot response to the stall warning including failure to advance the power levers to maximum and inappropriately raising the flaps. Flightcrew's inexperience in a  \"glass cockpit\" automated aircraft.", "While on approach the nose pitched up, the aircraft stalled and crashed short of the runway. Icing of the horizontal stabilizer.", "The cargo plane struck trees and high terrain after losing three engines during severe icing. Multiple engine failures occurred as a result of flight in extreme icing conditions. Incomplete performance of the emergency drills by the crew, as a result of not referring to the Emergency Checklist, prejudiced the chances of successful engine re-starts. Crew actions for securing and re-starting the failed engines, which were not in accordance with the operator's procedures, limited the power available. The drag from two unfeathered propellers of the failed engines and the weight of the heavily iced airframe resulted in a loss of height and control before the chosen diversion airfield could be reached. Poor Crew Resource Management reduced the potential for emergency planning, decision making and workload sharing. Consequently, the crew had no contingency plan for the avoidance of the forecast severe icing conditions, and also was unaware of the relative position of a closer diversion airfield which could have been chosen by making more effective use of air traffic services.", "The plane struck Cerro Carpich at 4,000 ft., 6 minutes after leaving the airport at Tingo Maria.", "The aircraft overran the runway and came to rest at the edge of the east river, after an aborted takeoff.

Failure of the pilot-in-command to assure the bilges were adequately pumped free of water, which resulted in the aft center of gravity limit to be exceeded, and failure of the aircrew to follow the checklist. A factor related to the accident was the water leak.", "The cargo plane lost a right engine during takeoff. The plane tried to return to the airport but crashed. The failure of the pilot-in-command to maintain airspeed. Factors to the accident were: cylinder fatigue, dark night and stall encountered.", "Lost an engine while taking off and then lost a second engine and crashed 1,300 ft. beyond the runway.", "The aircraft crashed after a captain allowed his child to manipulate the controls of the plane. The pilot's 11 year old daughter and 16 year old son were taking turns in the pilot's seat. While the boy was flying, he inadvertently disengaged the autopilot linkage to the ailerons and put the airliner in a bank of 90 degrees which caused the nose to drop sharply. The co-pilot pulled back on the yoke to obtain level flight but the plane stalled. With his seat pulled all the way back, the co-pilot in the right hand seat could not properly control the aircraft. After several stalls and rapid pull-ups the plane went into a spiral descent. In the end the co-pilot initiated a 4.8g pull-up and nearly regained a stable flight path but the aircraft struck the ground in an almost level attitude killing all aboard. The aircraft was named Glinka, after Mikhail Glinka, the father of Russian music.", "The helicopter crashed shortly after takeoff. The ingestion of foreign material (snow) in the engine, which resulted in a flameout (loss of engine power). Factors related to the accident were: the adverse weather conditions (snow falling & high density altitude), the lack of snow covers to protect the engine intakes while parked and awaiting for the weather conditions to improve, improper planning/decision by the pilot and the company/operator management, inadequate information in the flight manual, and the lack of suitable terrain for an emergency landing.", "Shortly after taking off, due to a false warning light, the captain idled one engine (contrary to the checklist) and  assumed they had an engine problem and returned to the airport. While attempting to land, the aircraft rolled to the right, pitched up, stalled and crashed. Inadequate use of the flight controls during an asymmetric go-around resulting in loss of control. Contributing factors were insufficient understanding of the flightcrew of the SAAB 340B engine oil system, lack of awareness of the consequences of an aircraft configuration with one engine in flight idle and poor crew resource management.", "Shot down by a missile.

The crew tried to override this situation by turning off the autothrottle and reducing air speed. The aircraft stalled, hit the runway tail first and burst into flames. The plane crashed because of an extreme out of trim configuration brought about by the fact that the tailplane setting had moved automatically and undetected to a maximum nose-up position. The plane climbed at a steep angle until it stalled.

The accident happened in generally good weather but with reduced visibility in clouds and haze at the mountain.", "The aircraft crashed in poor weather conditions 0.8 nm south of the threshold of runway 1R at Dulles International Airport while attempting a ILS landing. Poor airmanship and relative inexperience of the captain in initiating and continuing an unstabilized instrument approach that led to a descent below the authorized altitude without visual contact with the runway environment. Contributing to the cause of the accident was the lack of a GPWS on the airplane.", "Crashed on approach 3 miles short of the runway into a wooded area with flaps and landing gear still retracted.", "Shot down by Afghan troops.", "The plane crashed after demonstrating a simulated engine failure on takeoff. Caused by a number of factors relating to the test and actions of the crew none of which singley would have caused the crash. Unexpected mode transition to altitude acquire mode during a simulated  engine failure resulted in excessive pitch, loss of airspeed, and loss of control.

The approach was flown with slats/flaps at 15/20 degrees due to suspected windshear. Crew error. There was a struggle and argument between the captain and co-pilot during the last seconds of the landing as to whether they should go-around.", "The pilot flew into a blind box canyon and crashed while attempting to turn around. Improper in-flight planning /decision by the pilot and his failure to remain clear of mountainous terrain. The box canyon and proximity of mountains were related factors.", "The non-instrument rated commercial pilot was en route at 2000 feet msl on a night VFR flight when he reported an inadvertent encounter with instrument meteorological conditions. The helicopter (N124NH) subsequently crashed in a wooded area while in a steep descent. Continued VFR flight into IMC.", "The aircraft entered a steep dive from 16,000 ft. and crashed 10 minutes after taking off from Agadir. The pilot was blamed for disconnecting the autopilot and deliberately causing the crash and committing suicide. This was challenged by the Moroccan Pilot's Union.", "While on approach, the aircraft went into a sudden nose dive from 6,000 ft. and crashed into a wooded ravine 6 miles northwest of Pittsburgh International Airport. The accident was caused by a loss of control of the aircraft resulting from the movement of the rudder surface to its blowdown limit or an uncommanded rudder reversal. The rudder surface deflected in a direction opposite to that commanded by the pilots as a result of a jam of the main rudder PCU servo valve secondary slide to the servo valve housing offset from its neutral position and overtravel of the  primary slide. The most likely sequence of events that led up to the accident included the jamming of the PCU servo valve, the application of light left rudder followed by hard right rudder which caused the rudder to reverse in the opposite direction the pilot commanded it to go.  The application of hard right rudder was possibly initiated because the plane flew into the wake vortex of a B-727 which rolled the plane to the left.  Rudder hardover is normally corrected with the stick (ailerons) but because the plane was flying at the crossover speed of 190 knots with flaps 1, using the stick would not correct the situation. When the right rudder was applied the rudder went to its fullblown left position causing the plane to roll further left, stall and go into a dive. Some speculate if the pilot-in-command pushed forward on the yoke to gain some speed rather than pull back, the accident possibly could have been avoided. Blame was not placed on the crew because there was no mention of this type of recovery by the manufacturer nor was there any training for such an occurrence.", "The aircraft few into the side of a hill during heavy rain, high winds and severe turbulence.", "Just as the plane took off there was a pitch-up and stall resulting in the plane crashing into the water. The down elevator control cable failed at station 367 due to corrosion. The failure resulted from salt water induced corrosion. The aircraft had recently undergone a periodic inspection but the damage had apparently not been discovered.", "After circling for almost an hour and a half and aborting four landing attempts in adverse weather conditions, the aircraft ran out of fuel and crashed.", "The cargo plane lost control shortly after becoming airborne, began losing altitude and ditched 500 meters from the runway.

Overweight and improperly loaded.", "The aircraft was in a holding pattern and was descending to a newly assigned altitude of 8,000 feet when it experienced an uncommanded roll and excursion and crashed during a rapid descent. Icing. The design of the rubber de-icing boot was insufficient to deal with icing on the wings. Sudden and unexpected aileron hinge movement reversal, that occurred after a ridge of ice accreted beyond the deice boots while the airplane was in a holding pattern during which it intermittently encountered supercooled cloud and drizzle/rain drops, the size and water content of which exceeded those described in the icing certificication envelope. The airplane was susceptible to this loss of control and the crew was unable to recover. Contributing factor was the French Directorate General for Civil Aviation's inadequate oversight of the ATR42 and ATR 72, and its failure to take the necessary corrective action to ensure continued airworthiness in icing conditions and failure to provide the FAA with timely airworthiness information developed from previous ATR incidents and accidents in icing conditions.", "Crashed into the sea off of Cozumel while en route in poor weather condtions.

The plane made a safe emergency landing at Okinawa in spite of damage to the flight controls.", "The aircraft crashed 4 miles SW of runway 5L while on an ILS approach. The captain associated the illumination of the left engine ignition light with an engine failure, suspected an engine flame out and decided to execute a missed approach. This eventually led to a stall and the plane crashed 4 miles SW of the runway threshold. The captain's improper assumption that an engine had failed. The captain's subsequent failure to follow approved procedures for engine failure, single-engine approach, go-around, and stall recovery.
