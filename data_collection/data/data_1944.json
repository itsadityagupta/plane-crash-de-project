Wrong decision on part of the crew to reduce their altitude and flying in minima weather conditions.", "Disappeared over the English Channel en route from Bedford England to Paris, France. Band leader and musician Glenn Miller, 40, killed along with flight officer John Morgan and Lt. Colonel Norman Baessell. It has been theorized the plane may have been hit by bombs being jettisoned over the English Channel by RAF bombers on their way home from an unsuccessful raid. Wreckage and bodies were never found. The most accepted explanation is the pilot was not instrument rated and flew into worsening weather conditions and possibly carburetor icing caused an engine failure causing the plane to crash into the English Channel."]}
