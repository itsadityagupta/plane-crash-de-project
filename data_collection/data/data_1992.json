["The aircraft hit a mountain while on approach to Strasbourg. The crew was making a non-precision approach to runway 05. Design deficiencies with the rate-of-descent mode selector switch. The captain inadvertently selected 3,300 fpm descent on approach (displayed as 33) instead of 3.3 degree flight path angle (displayed as 3.3 in the same place on the panel) and this went unnoticed. The plane was slightly off course due to ATC error. No GPWS was installed. Both pilots had little time in an Airbus 320. There was inadequate training for non-precision approached. The electronic locator beacon was destroyed in crash, putting survivors at risk for over 4 hours before the wreckage was located.", "Exploded and crashed after being hit by a surface-to-air missile. Highest death toll in a commercial helicopter crash in aviation history.", "The aircraft descended below MDA in poor weather and struck Taquari Hill which was obscured by clouds.", "The crew was completing a training flight at Evansville Airport on behalf of the Kentucky National Guard, consisting of touch-and-go maneuvers. While on approach, the crew was instructed by ATC to go-around. After reaching an altitude of 1,500 ft. the plane stalled and nosedived into the Drury Hotel. All 5 crew members along with 12 people in the on the ground were killed. It is believed that the loss of control was the consequence of negligence on part of the crew who maintained an insufficient speed while initiating a go-around procedure, causing the aircraft to suffer an aerodynamic stall.", "The aircraft crashed into trees during its approach. The crew mistook the hotel lights for runway lights. Pilot error and malfunctioning equipment. Founder of Club Med and his son convicted of involuntary manslaughter in connection with this accident.", "After a missed approach by the copilot the captain took over but also executed a go-around.  He became spatially disoriented. When in a low nose and left bank attitude, control of the plane was transferred back to the first officer who began leveling the wings and raising the nose of the airplane. Impact with the ground occurred before the recovery was completed. The failure of the flight crew to properly recognize or recover in a timely manner from the unusual aircraft attitude that resulted from the captain's apparent spatial disorientation, resulting from physiological factors and/or a failed attitude director.", "A passenger died of cholera while en route.", "The cargo plane failed to gain altitude, cleared a fence and crashed to the ground. The wet runway contributed to the failure lift off in a timely manner.", "Crashed during a severe thunderstorm.", "The plane was de-iced two times while at the gate. Thirty-five minutes elapsed between the last de-icing and takeoff during which ice accumulated on the wings. After liftoff, the plane stalled, crashed and came to rest inverted and partially submerged in Flushing Bay. Failure of the airline industry and FAA to provide flight crews with procedures compatible with departure delays in conditions conducive to airframe icing and the decision by the flight crew to take off without positive assurance that the airplane's wings were free of ice accumulation after 35 minutes of exposure to precipitation following de-icing. The ice contamination on the wings resulted in an aerodynamic stall and loss of control after liftoff.", "The crew deviated from the ILS localizer during an approach to  Runway 33R and struck 2,000 foot Mount Hymittus.

The pilot's inadvertent feathering of the wrong propeller following an engine power loss and the failure of the operator to assure that the pilot was provided with adequate training in the airplane. Water contamination of fuel in the airport storage tanks. Lack of fuel quality control procedures.  Improper fuel servicing and exceeding the gross weight forward center of gravity limits of the airplane.", "During a sight seeing tour the aircraft hit a mountain on the island of Maui. The captain's decision to continue VFR into IFR conditions that obscured mountainous terrain and failure to properly use available navigational aids  to remain clear of terrain.", "The plane crashed in unstable weather while en route from Manshahr to Tehran.", "Twenty minutes after leaving Panama, the aircraft changed course to miss an area of thunderstorms. It then went into uncontrolled high speed dive and broke up at FL 100. Intermittent failure of one gyro caused non-synchronization of attitude indicators. Crew responded by selecting one gyro for both artificial horizons, but selected the wrong one. The selector control operated the opposite way from the one they had trained on. Failure to cross-check against standby indicator. Pilot came out of a left bank and continued into a right bank that eventually rolled the aircraft and caused it to go into a steep dive from which recovery was not possible.", "The aircraft lost control on final approach and crashed in a nose-down into the ground. Failure of the beta blocking device for undetermined reasons. The first officer's inadvertent activation of the power lever aft of the flight idle position and into the beta range, resulting in a loss of airplane control.", "The cargo plane crashed while on approach after the crew was distracted by a intermittent compartment warning.", "A missed approach was followed by the left wing and landing gear hitting the runway which led to a stall and crash, right of the runway. Crew error.", "Possibly shot down by LTTA  rebel forces as it attempted to land a the Elephant Pass Army Garrison.", "Cargo shifted as the cargo plane took off causing a high nose attitude which led to loss of contol.

The takeoff was aborted but the aircraft ran off the runway and caught fire. A defective stall warning system. A design flaw that allowed the defective stall warning system to go undetected. Failure of TWA's maintenance program to correct a repetitive malfunction of the stall warning system, and inadequate crew coordination between the captain and first officer that resulted in their inappropriate response to a false stall warning.", "The plan was to land at Kathmandu straight in from the south. After experiencing difficulty in deploying the flaps, the captain stated they were too high to come in for a direct landing. He asked to go around and make the approach again. The ATC did not have radar service. After some confusing exchanges between the tower and the aircraft, the captain instead of making a 180 degree turn towards the south, continued the turn to 360 degrees and headed north again. The aircraft eventually flew into a near vertical mountain wall at 240 knots. In the final seconds, the captain interpreted  the Ground Proximity Warning System warning as false. The accident was caused by a combination of occurrences, errors and actions by the captain and ATC. Specifically, the initial problem with the flaps, the lack of radar service, the captain trying to performing too many duties instead of relying on his co pilot,and the use of non-standard phraseology.", "The aircraft failed to gain altitude after lift-off, touched down again and overran the runway bursting into flames 2,000 feet past the runway.

Failure of the crew to follow prescribed procedures.", "Shortly after taking off from Schiphol Airport, while climbing through 6,500 feet, the No. 3 engine separated with its pylon from the aircraft and damaged the leading edge of the right wing. The No. 3 engine separated in such a way that the No. 4 engine and pylon also separated from the wing. During an attempted return to the airport, the aircraft crashed into a 11 story building in the Bijlmermeer residential district. The design and certification of the B-747 pylon was found to be inadequate to provide the required level of safety. The system to ensure structural integrity by inspection failed. The separation of the No. 3 engine was initiated by fatigue (corrosion) in the inboard midspar fuse pin. This led to loss of the No. 4 engine and pylon and damage to several systems which ultimately led to loss of control of the aircraft.", "Struck power lines and crashed.", "Crashed 45 miles southeast of Lanzhou while attempting to return to the airport after experiencing engine failure.", "The cargo plane veered off the runway and crashed while attempting to land at night with just the headlights of several trucks.", "The aircraft was descending in heavy rain when it crashed into Mt.

The high rate of descent in the final phase of the approach and the landing made on the right landing gear which exceeded the structural limitations of the aircraft.The crosswind, which exceeded the aircrafts limits and which occurred in the final phase of the approach and during landing. The combination of both factors caused stresses which exceeded the structural limitations of the aircraft. In addition, there were four moments when the pilots should have decided to abort the landing and do a go-around. This because the runway was flooded with water, the plane had left the flight path and was unstable during landing. In addition, the pilots did not properly correct for the windshear, flew too slowly and made errors with the automatic pilot.", "Midair collision with an Libyan Air Force fighter at 3,500 ft."]}
