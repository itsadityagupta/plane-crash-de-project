Airspeed slowed until the aircraft crashed.", "During an attempted go-around, the plane struck boat wakes and crashed. One passenger drowned.", "Tail rotor separated in flight shortly after takeoff. The helicopter autorotated and crashed. Fatigue fracture in tail rotor.", "The aircraft disappeared while en route. Wreckage was not discovered for over 5 years.", "The cargo plane crashed in heavy crosswind while attempting to takeoff. Inadequate preflight preparation and/or planning. Pilot in command failed to follow approved procedures,directives,etc. Cargo shifted.", "During takeoff just, as the plane lifted from the runway, the left engine and pylon separated from the aircraft damaging the wing and hydraulic system which caused the aircraft to roll and crash. Highest single plane death toll in U.S. aviation history. Asymmetrical stall and the ensuing roll of the aircraft because of the uncommanded retraction of the left wing outboard leading edge slats and the loss of stall warning and slat disagreement indication systems caused by separation of the engine and pylon. Improper maintenance procedures used by American Airlines when dismounting the engines for maintenance, by removing the pylon and engine together, putting strain on the engine mounts leading to  stress cracks.", "Crashed into the Atlantic Ocean during a blinding sandstorm. The pilot, unable to land due to the sandstorm headed out to sea for another approach when the accident occurred.", "The aircraft crashed into a wooded area during a non-precision approach to Rockland, in fog . Failure to arrest aircraft's descent rate, without the runway in sight. Inordinate management pressures, the first officer's marginal instrument proficiency, the captain's inadequate supervision of the flight, inadequate crew training and the captain's chronic fatigue were all factors in the accident.", "Crashed near the Karmwal Pass at 16,000 ft. mountain 10 minutes after taking off from Leh.", "The plane crashed in a heavily wooded area about 1.5 miles northeast of Barnstable Municipal Airport while on an ILS approach. The failure of the flightcrew to recognize and react in a timely manner to the gross deviation from acceptable approach parameters, resulting in a continuation of the descent well below the decision height during a precision approach without visual contact with the runway environment. Pilot fatigue.", "Struck Mt. Sebayak at 5,500 ft. during its approach. Pilot error.The plane was named \"Mamberamo.\"", "Crashed into a rain forest. Pilot-in-command continuing the flight into conditions where he lost visual reference with the ground which resulted in the aircraft colliding with terrain.", "Crashed in low ceiling and rain. Fluxgate compass inoperative because of chafed wires.", "On a third practice touch-and-go landing, the plane yawed to the right, stalled and crashed in an inverted attitude.", "The aircraft attained a nose-high attitude and pitched up shortly after taking off. The pilot's loss of control of the aircraft after takeoff because of the aircraft's grossly overweight and out-of-balance condition which resulted from misloading by the company's load control personnel. The misloading was due to the failure of the company to supervise and enforce its loading procedures.", "Crashed into the sea after overrunning the runway while taking off. Locked condition of the elevators which prevented the rotation of the aircraft into a flying attitude. Gust lock became re-engaged during pre- flight check.", "The aircraft crashed 1,000 feet short of the runway during a landing attempt at Akron-Canton airfield. Baseball player Thurman Munson, 32,  who was piloting the aircraft, was killed. Munson who was practicing takeoffs and landings, allowed the plane to get too low and then slowed the aircraft to 10 knots below safe landing speed.", "Crashed due to engine failure on approach.", "Crashed into the Kiroli Hills while on approach to Bombay at night. Momentary/intermittent loss of electrical contact in the G/S system of aircraft which gave the pilot an erroneous impression of the interception of the glide slope.", "Midair collision at 27,200 ft. Separation error by air traffic controller. Eight-four killed on the 65735 and 94 on the 65816. Fourteen players and 3 staff members of the Russian soccer team, Pakhtakor Tashkent were killed.", "Crashed into a wooded area after all four engines flamed out. Fuel contamination.", "The aircraft lost control went into a spin and crashed after an uncommanded flap extension at FL270.", "The plane undershot the runway and crashed.", "Crashed into the sea after taking off.", "The plane was transporting company employees when it hit Surveyor Mountain 7 minutes after taking off from Klamath Falls. The plane hit trees along the crest of a mountain ridge along the flight path. Crew error. The crew's decision to undertake a direct point-to-point high cruise speed flight at low altitude.", "The aircraft hit a mountain at an altitude of 2,000 ft. during an approach in poor weather. Crew's misjudgement in selection of a low altitude flight profile and inadequate ATC assistance.", "Struck high ground in thick fog.", "Crashed while attempting touch and go landings.", "The aircraft was on finals when it suddenly turned right and descended in a right wing-down attitude, striking the ground and cartwheeling into trees.", "The aircraft overran the runway and crashed with the left wing and tail separating before the aircraft came to a rest. The crew touched down too far down the runway at a speed higher than normal after a non-stabilized final approach. The crew did not fully apply the braking systems after a touchdown under known adverse conditions.", "The plane crashed after engine failure for undetermined reasons. Improper flap configueration. Plane overloaded. Hurried departure. Inadequate flight training.", "The cargo plane crashed on takeoff. Improper loading.", "The aircraft struck a vehicle after landing on a closed runway in fog. The tower warned the flight three times about the closed runway. Non-compliance with the meteorological minima for the approach procedure, as cleared.  Failure to comply with the aircraft's operating procedures during the approach phase, and landing on a runway closed to traffic.", "While en route from Chicago to Washington an explosive device detonated in the baggage compartment. The aircraft was flying at an altitude of approximately 34,500 feet, when the flight crew experienced a noise which they described as a thump. Smoke subsequently filled the cabin and the aircraft was forced to make an emergency landing at Washington-Dulles Airport. The bomb was planted by the Unabomber, a man who had been accused of attacks over an 18-year period. He was arrested in April 1996 and subsequently received a life sentence.", "The cargo plane descended below the decision height without having established ground contact and crashed into a wooded area.", "During the descent the aircraft attained a high airspeed and high rate of descent and disintegrated in flight. A progressive failure in the aircraft's electrical system leading to the disabling or erratic performance of some critical flight instruments and flight instrument lighting while the flight was operating in night instrument meteorological condition. As a result of these conditions, the flight crew could not resolve the instrumentation anomalies to determine proper aircraft attitude reference, and became disoriented and lost control of the aircraft. The crew's efforts to regain control of the aircraft imposed aerodynamic loads which exceeded design limits of the aircraft and caused it to break up in flight.", "After being airborne about a half an hour a cabin attendant reported a fire in the aft cabin area. Seventeen minutes later the aircraft crashed into a rocky desert while attempting an emergency landing. The blaze may have been started by a passenger possibly from a leaking kerosene stove carried aboard by a Haj pilgrim passenger.", "The aircraft crashed into the slopes of Mt. Erebus while on sightseeing flight to Antarctica. An incorrect computer-stored flight plan resulted in a navigational error directing the flight towards Mt. Erebus. Because of overcast, the crew descended below authorized altitude. Contributing to the accident was the crew's inexperience with flying the Antarctic route. Information about the navigational errors was suppressed by officials.", "?", "Shifting cargo caused the pilot to lose control and crash into a hotel.", "?", "Impacted a mountainside at an altitude of 3400 m.", "Crashed into the jungle on a domestic flight 20 miles from its destination. Severe thunderstorms associated with windshear and  a hurricane is believed to have caused the crash.", "Crashed into Cubuk Hill in fog, two minutes away from landing at the airport.
