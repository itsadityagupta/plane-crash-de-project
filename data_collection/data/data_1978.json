Crew error.  The failure and inability of the flightcrew to prevent rapid pitchup and stall by exerting sufficient push force on the control wheel. The pitchup was caused by the combination of a mistrimmed horizontal stabilizer and a center of gravity near the aircraft's aft limit. The mistrimmed condition resulted from discrepancies in the aircraft's trim system and the flightcrew's preoccupation with making a timely departure. The out-of-trim warning system was inoperative.", "The aircraft touched down just as the crew noticed a snow plow on the runway.

Failure of the crew to monitor altitude and descent rate and the failure of the 1st officer to provide the captain with the required altitude and approach performance call-outs. Also the flight engineer disabled the GPWS alarm so the crew could hear one another better. In addition, the night flight had been diverted from its primary airport due to poor weather and was required to execute a compressed approach (descending and approaching more quickly and steeply than normal), and the crucial altimeter readout was an old drum-roll-counter type (due to be replaced), which could easily be misread, especially in  heavy workload situations. Three fatalities occurred when the frightened passengers grabbed their seat cushions and exited the plane from the rear. They drowned in part because their seat cushions were not flotation cushions.

The No. 3 tire failed on takeoff and debris damaged the right gear 'down and locked' switch, causing a gear unsafe indication in the cockpit. Debris was also ingested by the No. 2 engine causing a loss of reverse thrust during the rejected takeoff.", "The aircraft, flying VFR, collided with a mountain in deteriorating weather condtions after being blown off course which went unnoticed because of lacking navigational equipment.", "Crashed shortly after taking off from runway 18.", "Crashed on takeoff. Down elevator control stop backed out, limiting down elevator travel to 1 1/2 degrees of normal 20 degrees.", "Crashed in a swamp.", "While on approach, the aircraft yawed to the left and plunged into the ocean in a left-wing and nose-down attitude and sank.

Shortly after departing Kariba, the starboard wing was hit by a SAM-7 missile.  The crew tried to make an emergency landing in a large clearing in the bush. The aircraft crash landed, striking an irrigation ditch, cart-wheeled, broke up and caught fire.

The 727 overtook and struck the Cessna from the rear. The primary cause was the PSA crew lost sight of the Cessna and did not make that fact known to the ATC.  The ATC failed to realize from the PSA transmissions that they lost sight of the Cessna. One hundred thirty-five killed on the PSA, two on the Cessna and seven on the ground. Crew fatigue may have played a part in the accident as there are unofficial reports that the crew attended an all night party and had only 2 hours sleep from the night before.", "After taking off, one of engines stalled due to a damaged #5 cylinder exhaust.
