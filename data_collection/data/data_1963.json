The Viscount aircraft had an IFR flight plan but was cruising under VFR conditions and did not see the C-47 until it was too late.", "The aircraft struck approach lights 1,170 feet from the runway threshold, climbed to about 200 feet and then crashed approximately 1,900 feet beyond the threshold and on the left edge of Runway 28L. Continuation of an instrument approach after adequate visual reference was lost below authorized minimums. Inadequate monitoring of the  instrument approach by the PAR controller was a contributing factor.", "The plane stalled and crashed.", "The aircraft crashed 37 miles west-southwest of Miami after penetrating a thunderstorm and encountering severe turbulence. The aircraft initially entered an area of updrafts followed by downdrafts which put the aircraft into a high speed dive. While trying to pull out of the dive, the aircraft broke apart from excessive g forces. The crew is believed to have concentrated on maintaining a given airspeed in an extreme turbulence condition instead of flying attitude. In doing so, excessive stress was applied to the wings which separated from the fuselage. The weather was considerably worse than forecast.", "Chartered by CBC-TV for filming a wilderness documentary for \"Camera Canada\", the plane apparently went too low and collided with treetops.

They were to travel  from Kansas City, Kansas, to Nashville. West tried to persuade Cline to ride in the car, believing it was safer. Cline was eager to return home to her children and wanted to take her flight. She refused to ride with West. Cline allegedly told West she was ready if it was her time to leave.
