A go-around was attempted but it was too late and the aircraft overran the runway.", "A Peruvian air force plane carrying villagers stranded by flooding crashed while attempting to land at Piura Airport. The pilot tried to glide the plane after losing an engine but crashed near a shantytown 2 kilometers from the airport.

The pilot's failure to maintain altitude while operating in adverse weather. A contributing factor was the incoming fog and high tension static wire.", "The aircraft crashed into the side of a mountain at 2,800m,  13 minutes after taking off from Erdenet.

Overloaded.", "Flight 420 took off from Montreal's Dorval Airport on a flight to Peterborough  About 12 minutes after take off, at an altitude of 12,500 feet, the crew advised ATC that they had a hydraulic problem and requested clearance to return to Dorval. The crew then advised ATC that the left engine had been shut down because it was on fire. The crew decided to proceed to Mirabel International Airport. Then crew then advised ATC that the engine fire was out. On final for Runway 24, the crew advised ATC that the left engine was again on fire. The landing gear was extended on short final, and when the aircraft was over the runway, the left wing broke upwards. The fuselage inverted, struck the runway and slid 2,500 feet and came to rest on the left side of the runway.  PC: The crew did not realize that the pull to the left and the extended take-off run were due to the left brakes' dragging, which led to overheating of the brake components. The dragging caused overheating and leakage, probably at one of the piston seals that retain the brake hydraulic fluid. When hydraulic fluid leaked onto the hot brake components, the fluid caught fire and initiated an intense fire in the left nacelle, leading to failure of the main hydraulic system. When the L WING OVHT light went out, the overheating problem appeared corrected; however, the fire continued to burn. The crew never realized that all of the problems were associated with a fire in the wheel well, and they did not realize how serious the situation was. The left wing was weakened by the wing/engine fire and failed, rendering the aircraft uncontrollable.", "The helicopter impacted a mountain on a sightseeing trip. The pilot's decision to continue VFR flight into deteriorating weather conditions consisting of lowering ceilings and visibility in mountainous terrain, which resulted in the inadvertent entry into instrument meteorological conditions and a collision with a mountainside.

The pilot had reported an engine problem about 20 minutes earlier.", "Midair collision. The Beechcraft was on a flight from Lyon to Lorient, approaching Lorient, when it requested permission to fly over the ocean liner Norway. While circling the Norway, it collided with the Cessna. One killed aboard the Cessna, 14 aboard the Beechcraft.  The pilots of the Beechcraft decided to deviate from their course in order to give passengers a view of the ocean liner Le France. This is unusual but not forbidden. They also descended to 2,000 feet, below the level of radar detection. Both planes approached each other within blind spots. Failure of both pilots to \"see and avoid\" each other under VFR conditions.", "Shortly after taking off the plane pitched up, stalled and crashed to the ground. The  pitch-up was caused by an uncommanded downward movement of the horizontal stabilizer. This was due to a partial detachment of the actuator forward bearing support fitting due to the non-installation of required hi-lok fasteners.", "The pilot made three low passes over the water in an attempt to land at Kincolith. On the fourth approach, the aircraft touched down, apparently in a controlled manner, and skipped on the water surface. The floats then dug into the water followed by the right wing, which was severed from the fuselage on water impact. The aircraft quickly overturned and came to rest inverted with only the bottom of the floats visible. All five occupants drowned. On touchdown, the floats struck the water and caused a flying attitude that the pilot could not control before the right wing dug in and the aircraft overturned. Contributing to the accident were conflicting wind and water conditions at the time of the occurrence.", "Blew a tire while landing causing the plane to to run off the runway and crash.", "While en route, the aircraft experienced double engine failure.
