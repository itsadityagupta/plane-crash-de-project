On the second approach the captain descended below MDA and  the aircraft struck the ground in controlled flight 2 nm short of the runway. The aircraft was destroyed. The captain decided to descend below the minimum descent altitude without the required visual references. After descending below MDA, both pilots were preoccupied with acquiring and maintaining visual contact with the ground and did not adequately monitor the flight instruments; thus, the aircraft flew into the ice.", "The pilot-in-command lost control during touch-and-go landing and crashed.", "The aircraft departed Adana to pick up Turkish pilgrims. The plane crashed 9 minutes after taking off in poor weather conditions. Severe weather probably contributed to the cause of the accident. Pitot anti-icing system was probably not activated because of missed checklist items.

A fan of computer flight-simulation games, he stated he just wanted to fly a real plane.  After forcing the co-pilot out of the cockpit he ordered the captain to fly to a U.S. Air Force base in western Tokyo. When he refused, he stabbed the captain and seized the controls.

The plane was returning to the island of Sao Vicente where it originally departed  due to poor weather conditions over the destination city. The pilot possibly lost visibility due to the fog and rain and crashed into a cliff in Santo Antao.", "While making a landing in strong winds and rain, the pilot-in-command disconnected the autopilot but left the autothrottle engaged. The aircraft, with a weight close to the maximum landing weight permitted, stabilized slightly low on the glideslope. An attempt was made to flare but the aircraft landed hard on its right landing gear and the No.3 engine touched the runway. The right main landing gear and right wing separated. The MD-11 then inverted and skidded off the runway in flames. Probable Cause: The commander's unability to arrest the high rate of descent existing at 50 ft. RA. Contributory Causes:  The commander's failure to appreciate the combination of a reducing airspeed, increasing rate of descent, and with the thrust decreasing to flight idle.\nThe commander's failure to apply power to counteract the high rate of descent prior to touchdown. Probable variations in wind direction and speed below 50 ft RA may have resulted in a momentary loss of headwind component and, in combination with the early retardation of the thrust levers, and at a weight only just below the maximum landing weight, led to a 20 kt loss in indicated airspeed just prior to touchdown. A possible contributory cause may have been a reduction in peripheral vision as the aircraft entered the area of the landing flare, resulting in the commander not appreciating the high rate of descent prior to touchdown.", "A fire in the front portion of the cabin, in the overhead luggage compartment, caused thick black smoke to accumulate in the cabin.

The Boeing 757 left the runway at high speed, approximately 1,000m from the second touchdown point. It then ran 343m across flat grassland beside the runway, before going diagonally over a substantial earth mound adjacent to the airport boundary, becoming semi airborne as a result. Beyond the mound it hit a number of medium sized trees and the right engine struck the boundary fence. The aircraft then passed through the fence, re-landed in a field and both main landing gears collapsed. It finally stopped after a slide across the field.

A possible pressurization failure, as indicated by frosted windows, observed by fighter jet pilots trailing the plane, may have killed all aboard. Pro golfer, Payne Stewart, 42, killed. Incapacitation of the flight crewmembers as a result of their failure to receive supplemental oxygen following a loss of cabin pressurization, for undetermined reasons. Possible contributing factor: The emergency checklist was written in such a way that it did not direct the crew first don their face masks.", "The plane took off from JFK at 1:19 a.m. bound for Cairo, Egypt. Thirty-three minutes later, after attaining an altitude of 33,000 feet, it was observed on radar in an extremely rapid descent. The aircraft was observed in a 66 degree dive at 483 knots.

After that, the plane began a second dive and broke up at around 10,000 ft. crashing into the Atlantic Ocean, 60 miles southeast of Nantucket Island.  The aircraft was named Thutmosis III. The accident was caused by the relief first officer's flight control inputs which caused the airplane's departure from normal cruise flight and subsequent impact with the Atlantic Ocean. The reason for the first officer's actions were not determined by the NTSB. One could conclude the actions were deliberate in an attempt to commit suicide.", "The plane was on a flight from Tujuana to Mexico City, with stops at Guadalajara and Uruapan.

As the captain initiated a procedural turn to the left, the comparator warning sounded 9 more times.. The aircraft then banked left progressively and entered a descent until it struck the ground in a 40 degree nose down attitude at a high rate of speed. The pilots did not respond appropriately to the comparator warnings during the climb after takeoff from Stansted despite prompts from the flight engineer. The commander, as the handling pilot, maintained a left roll control input, rolling the aircraft to approximately 90 of left bank and there was no control input to correct the pitch attitude throughout the turn. The first officer either did not monitor the aircraft attitude during the climbing turn or, having done so, did not alert the commander to the extreme unsafe attitude that developed.", "The plane was hijacked and subsequently flown to Amritsar, India, Lahore, Pakistan, al-Minhar Air Base, Dubai and Kandahar, Afghanistan.
