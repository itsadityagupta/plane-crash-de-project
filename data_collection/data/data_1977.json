The loss of control during initial climb was the result of a premature raise of the flaps, which caused the aircraft to reach a critical angle of attack and to stall.", "Crashed in whiteout conditions. Possible spatial disorientation on final.", "Crashed into the ocean. Engine failure.", "The aircraft crashed into cloud obscured  Mt. Serra shortly after taking off from San Giusto Airport at Pisa. The plane was seen making a evasive maneuver before slamming into the mountain peak.", "The cargo plane crashed short of the runway while attempting to land.  The crew continued the approach below the glide until impact with ground.", "Both aircraft were diverted to Tenerife because of a bombing at Las Palmas Airport. After an extended delay,  both planes were instructed to back track up the runway. The KLM plane reached its takeoff point while the Pan Am plane was still on the runway. The Pan Am plane continued up the runway missing the taxiway turnout. There was heavy fog on the runway. The KLM plane began its takeoff roll without permission with the Pan Am plane still on the runway. The controller and Pan Am pilot each radioed a warning to the KLM plane, but were not heard because the simultaneous transmissions interfered with each other.The KLM plane hit the Pan Am plane just as it was taking off. Both planes burst into flames.  KLM 234 + 14 crew,  Pan Am 326 + 9 crew killed. All aboard the KLM plane were killed. The KLM captain was their safety officer and for some months had  been training other pilots using a simulator, where getting takeoff permission was not simulated. The Pan Am aircraft was named Clipper Victor. The KLM aircraft was named Rhine River. Despite all the circumstances the KLM plane was blamed for taking off without permission by the NTSB.", "After spotting a mountain in front of him, the pilot applied full power and went into a steep climb. The plane stalled and crashed into trees.", "The crew continued their visual approach after entering an area of fog with visibility less than 500 m and losing sight of the ground. After deciding to go around, the right wing hit a 9-meter high pole. The wing caught fire and the number 2 engine failed. The fuselage hit the ground sideways in a field about 1,500 meters from the runway. The plane broke up and caught fire. The pilot-in-command decided to continue the approach below the glide under VFR mode in IMC conditions.", "The aircraft sustained a broken windshield and loss of power to both engines after penetrating a thunderstorm and encountering hail. The plane crash landed on a highway and exploded in flames. Total and unique loss of thrust from both engines while the aircraft was penetrating an area of severe thunderstorms with heavy precipitation and hail. The hail clogged bleeder valves in the engines causing multipe engine surges until the compressors tore apart. Contributing factor was the failure of the company's dispatcher to provide the flight crew with up-to-date severe weather information.", "Crashed on the slopes of the Rio Guape mountains.

Flight at an unsafe altitude into an area of unfamiliar terrain.", "The cargo plane struck power lines and trees while attempting to land.", "The elevator assembly separated in mid-flight. The plane nose dived and crashed. The in-flight separation of the right hand horizontal stabilizer and elevator as a result of a combination of metal fatigue and inadequate failsafe design in the rear spar structure. Shortcomings in design assessment, certification and inspection procedures were contributory factors.", "While passengers were loading aboard the helicopter on top of the Pan Am building, the landing  gear collapsed causing the helicopter to tip on its side.  Four people, waiting to board the craft  were killed by the rotating blades. One of the blades tore loose and struck a window breaking in two. One-half of the blade then sailed two blocks striking and killing a pedestrian, 800 feet below the heliport.

The aircraft was being flown at reduced power and went unnoticed by the crew until it struck the ground in level flight..", "The aircraft struck a hill 4 miles short of the runway while on  a VOR approach during a thunderstorm. Crew error. Descended below MDA.", "The crew diverted to Mc Comb because of low fuel. Both engines quit before the aircraft could land and a forced landing was attempted in a wooded area. The plane struck trees before it could make a forced landing in an open field. Lead singer Ronnie Van Zant, 29, guitarist Stevie Gaines, back up vocalist Cassie Gaines and assistant manager Dean Kilpatrick of the Lynyrd Skynyrd band killed.  Several other members of the band were seriously injured. Fuel exhaustion due to crew inattention of the fuel supply. Contributing factors were improper flight planning and a malfunction in the No.2 engine which caused a higher than normal fuel consumption.", "After lifting a water container the aircraft began rotating until control was lost and contact was made with the ground, shearing off the tail rotor and a large portion of the tail assembly. New engines were installed in the CH-53s to increase the power of the main rotor and on a whole to make the helicopter more powerful. However, it was soon evident that the tail rotor could not balance the increased power created by the main rotor. Under certain conditions the aircraft would become unstable and lose directional heading. Sikorsky warns of these conditions. To compensate for the mistake that had been made, Sikorsky designed and tested a bell crank system to stabilize the rear rotor. After seven years, this helicopter was still not retrofitted with the bell crank system. Gross weight of the container exceeded the lifting capacity of the helicopter. No restrains used by the passengers.", "Exploded, crashed and burned on approach.", "The cargo plane failed to gain altitude and crashed into trees.", "The aircraft landed 1,000 ft. past the aiming point of the runway in heavy rain, overran the runway and plunged off a cliff during a third landing attempt. Hydroplaning, due to poor drainage on the runway. Excessive speed during landing. In the last attempt, the plane was 44 ft high in the begining of the runway flying at 150 kt. Then a sudden tail wind increases the speed to 155 kt. Cross winds from several directions made the plane unstable. Tail winds alternated with frontal winds making the speed unstable. The plane only hit the runway after 800m. The same cross winds make it impossible to align to the center of the runway. Then aquaplaning did the rest.", "The flight crashed into high ground after a second landing attempt. Procedural error by the crew during the final approach in that they abandoned the ILS procedure. This was influenced by the interruption of the VOR signal.", "Crashed into mountains north of the city in fog and adverse weather conditions.", "After not being able to land at the scheduled airport due to fog, the crew could not find the alternate airport, ran out of fuel and crashed.", "During a hijacking and while descending from 21,000 to 7,000 feet, both pilots were shot and the aircraft crashed into a swamp.", "Collided with cable crane.

Killed, were the entire Evansville basketball team. The aileron on one wing and rudder remained locked upon takeoff, which made it extremely difficult to bank. An attempted takeoff with the rudder and right aileron control locks installed, in combination with a rearward center of gravity. Improperly loaded luggage which resulted in rearward center of gravity which resulted in the aircraft's rotating to a nose-high attitude immediately after takeoff and entering the region of reversed command from which the pilot was unable to recover.", "While in a holding pattern because of electrical problems the cargo plane cashed into 7,600 ft. mountain. The approach controller's issuance and the flight crew's acceptance of an incomplete and ambiguous holding clearance in combination with the flight crew's failure to adhere to prescribed impairment-of-communications procedures and prescribed holding procedures. The controller's and flight crew's actions are attributed to probable habits of imprecise communication and of imprecise adherence to procedures developed through years of exposure to operations in a radar environment. Contributing to the accident was the failure of the aircraft's No.1 electrical system for unknown reasons.", "Ditched into the ocean while on a second approach. Crew error.
