The plane was to land on runway 30 at Payham Airport but instead landed on runway 31L at Fat'h Airport. Runway 30 is more than twice as long as runway 31L.The plane went off the runway, smashed through an airport wall separating the airport from a residential neighborhood, broke up and caught fire. Only the fight engineer survived.", "ATC lost radar contact with the cargo jet when it was 30 miles southeast of George Bush International Airport. The plane crashed into Trinity Bay and broke apart in muddy water about 5 feet deep.  The probable cause of this accident was the inappropriate response by the first officer as the pilot flying to an inadvertent activation of the go-around mode, which led to his spatial disorientation and nose-down control inputs that placed the airplane in a steep descent from which the crew did not recover. Contributing to the accident was the captain\u0092s failure to adequately monitor the airplane\u0092s flightpath and assume positive control of the airplane to effectively intervene. Also contributing were systemic deficiencies in the aviation industry\u0092s selection and performance measurement practices, which failed to address the first officer\u0092s aptitude-related deficiencies and maladaptive stress response. Also contributing to the accident was the Federal Aviation Administration\u0092s failure to implement the pilot records database in a sufficiently robust and timely manner.", "While on approach to land, the crew contacted ATC and declared an emergency after which the airplane crashed in flames in a palm grove, 35 km south of La Vanguardia Airport. The crew reported engine problems.", "The internationally scheduled airliner crashed 6 minutes after taking off from Addis Ababa-Bole Airport. The pilot sent out a distress call and was given clearance to return to the airport. The crash site, some 31 miles southeast of the airport, contained a smoky crater with small pieces of wreckage. When the 737 Max 8 was designed, it necessitated placing the engines more forward. This gave the plane a tendency to be nose heavy. To compensate for this, the MCAS system was written into the software. No one was told of this, not the pilots or  airlines and did not appear in any manual. The MCAS was activated by the angle-of-attack sensor. The system only depended on one angle-of-attack sensor. If the angle-of attack sensor sensed a nose down attitude, it would adjust the trim and bring the plane to level flight. On the accident plane, the angle-of-attack sensor was faulty and gave false readings which caused the plane to pitch up. It also caused incorrect airspeed and altitude readings. The pilot tried to correct the nose-up attitude, but the system kept pushing the nose up. Eventually the plane\u0092s stall speed was reached, and the plane went into a dive and crashed. A simple disconnect of the stabilizer trim would have solved the problem.", "While the aircraft was in the initial climb, plane lost height and crashed in flames into a house located in a residential area about 400 meters from the airfield.", "The aircraft crashed while en route on a return trip from Las Vegas to Monterrey, Mexico.", "Forty-five minutes after taking off from Moscow's Sheremetyevo Airport, the plane returned to make an emergency landing. About 16-21nm west of Sheremetyevo Airport there was a thunderstorm. The aircraft was climbing through 7,900 feet when an electrical failure occurred, the flight control system degraded to \"DIRECT MODE\", the autopilot automatically disconnected; the aircraft was in the middle of thunderstorm activity. The captain assumed manual control of the aircraft until the end of the flight. The crew decided to return to Sheremetyevo and performed a manual ILS approach to runway 24L. At the time the aircraft intercepted the glideslope the aircraft\u0092s mass was above the maximum landing weight. The crew deployed the flaps to 25 degrees in accordance with the flight crew operating manual for flight with minimum mode (DIRECT MODE) of the FCS as well as landing above MLW. At 15:26Z the crew set the emergency transponder code. Vapp was determined to be 155 KIAS, the descent on the glideslope was stabilised and without any deviation from Vapp. Descending between 1,100 and 900 feet the crew received 5 cycles of predictive windshear warnings. Descending through 260 feet AGL the aircraft began to deviate below the glide slope, a \u0091GLIDESLOPE\u0092 warning occurred. Descending between 180 to 40 feet the engine thrust was increased causing the aircraft to accelerate to 164 knots. At 16 feet AGL the speed was 170 KIAS. A Terrain Awareness Warning System aural signal \u0091Retard\u0092 occurred. The engine thrust was reduced to idle. At that point the captain began to apply oscillating pitch inputs with increasing amplitude which changed the pitch angle up to +6 and -2 degrees. The aircraft made a \"three point\" touchdown 900 meters past the runway threshold at 158 KIAS and a vertical load of +2.55G and bounced up to 6 feet AGL. The spoilers did not deploy. In DIRECT MODE they are not permitted to operate automatically and need to be extended manually, however the spoilers were not manually extended by the crew. Two seconds after the first touchdown the aircraft touched down a second time with the nose gear first at 155 KIAS and +5.85G. The aircraft bounced off again to 18 feet AGL. A third touchdown occurred at 140 KIAS in excess of +5G resulting in the destruction of the construction, a fuel spill and fire.", "Crashed about 34km WNW of Mechuka.", "The Pakistani military plane, on a training flight, crashed into residential structures in Mora Kalu Village on the outskirts of Rawalpindi. The aircraft was destroyed killing 18 people, including the 2 pilots, 3 crew members and 14 civilians on the ground.", "The Cargo plane was preparing to land at Toledo when it crash into a truck repair shop, one-half  mile short of the runway. Both persons aboard were killed.", "The chartered cargo plane, planning to stop for refueling at Lviv, and continue on to Istanbul, ran out of fuel and crashed less than a mile from the runway into brush.", "The passenger plane crashed about a minute after taking off from Goma Airport into the Mapendo neighborhood,", "While taking off, the tail of the plane struck the runway twice, the aircraft lost altitude, went through a perimeter fence and crashed into a two-story building 700 meters from the end of the runway. There was no fire."]}
