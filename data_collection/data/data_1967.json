Most probably the captain suffered a heart attack and the first officer could not regain control of aircraft.", "Flight 9877 was scheduled to provide crew training for a captain trainee and a flight engineer trainee. In addition the flight engineer instructor was being given a routine proficiency check. The flight departed the ramp at 00:40 with the captain trainee in the left seat and the check captain in the right seat. At 00:43 the crew advised the tower they were ready for takeoff and would like to circle and land on Runway 1. The tower cleared them as requested. The aircraft was observed to make what appeared to be a normal takeoff and departure. At 00:47 the crew reported on base leg for Runway 1, and the controller cleared the flight to land. A subsequent discussion revealed that they would execute a simulated two-engine out approach, execute a full stop landing and then takeoff on runway 19. The tower controller observed Flight 9877 in a shallow left turn on what appeared to be a normal final approach. The degree of bank increased to approximately 60 degrees or greater when the aircraft hit the power lines approximately 2,300 feet short and 1,100 feet west of the runway threshold. The DC-8 crashed into a residential area, destroying several homes and a motel complex.

Series of errors by the crew due to intoxication by carbon monoxide fumes. Difficulty in communication between the ATC and crew due to lack of phraseology.", "The aircraft crashed a during a landing attempt. Loss of power in both starboard engines resulting in control difficulties. Fuel starvation due to inadvertent fuel transfer. Inadvertent fuel transfer in flight on a scale sufficient to involve the risk, after a long flight, of emptying the tank expected to contain sufficient fuel can occur if the fuel selector levers in the cockpit of this type of aircraft are incorrectly positioned by even a small amount. This is easy to do and difficult for the pilot to recognize.", "Crashed on final approach.", "The pilot attempted an overshoot maneuver, following the stoppage of the port engine, at too low a speed (below the minimum control speed) resulting in an uncontrollable turn towards the Airport buildings.", "Crashed into a residential neighborhood while attempting to return to the airport following an engine failure.", "The pilot became lost and ran out of fuel crashing into a swamp.

Incorrect installation of a valve caused hot air to ignite hydraulic fluid. The fire resulted from engine bleed air flowing back through the malfunctioning non-return valve and an open air delivery valve, through the auxiliary power unit in a reverse direction, and exiting into the plenum chamber at temperatures sufficiently high to cause the acoustics linings to ignite.", "Crashed while en route.", "Ditched into the sea while on approach during a typhoon. Crew did not follow proper approach procedures.  The captain did not monitor the approach properly and the co-pilot mishandled the aircraft after descending below minimum altitude.", "Crashed into a mountain in poor weather. Pilot error. Decision to fly VFR over rugged terrain in IFR conditions.", "Crashed minutes after takeoff.", "Crashed 2,500 feet beyond the runway while taking off from Ivato airport in fog.

Loss of directional control developing from separation of the right nose wheel tread.  Inability to stop within the normally adequate runway distance available due to use of differential braking, impaired performance and an increase in tail wind component and aircraft weight over those used in calculating the aircraft's acceleration /stoping performance.", "While on the takeoff roll a loud bang was heard as the aircraft passed a Delta plane and the takeoff was aborted. The aircraft overran the runway and crashed and burned. The inability of the TWA crew to abort successfully their takeoff at the speed attained prior to the attempted abort. The abort was understandably initiated because of the first officer's belief that his plane had collided with a Delta aircraft stopped just off the runway. A contributing factor was the action of the Delta crew in advising the tower that their plane was clear of the runway without carefully ascertaining the facts, and when in fact their aircraft was not a safe distance under the circumstances of another aircraft taking off on that runway.", "The plane climbed to 700 ft. and crashed into the ground. Malfunctioning artificial horizon and compass.", "The aircraft struck a tree short of the runway during an approach in snow. Procedural errors by the crew during the approach in adverse weather. The visual approach conducted at night and in deteriorating weather conditions without adequate altimeter cross-reference. The approach was conducted using visual reference to partially lighted irregular terrain which may have been conducive to producing an illusionary sense of adequate terrain clearance.", "The aircraft crashed and burned on a slope of a mountain in light rain and low visibility as it diverted to Nha.Trang from it scheduled landing at Qui Nhon.", "The cargo plane crashed inverted into a river.", "The plane flew into 10,500 ft.

The failure of the crew to perform a pre-takeoff control check resulting in takeoff with the elevators immobilized by a control batten.", "During poor weather and after a flyby, the pilot requested a Runway 18 approach. The pilot decided to make a visual approach along the middle of 3 diverging roads, which was aligned with the runway. Because of the fog, the pilot began his approach along the third road which extended to the Royal Thai Air Force fuel storage instead of Runway 18. When the aircraft got close to the ground, the pilot realized that he was approaching the wrong road. He tried to initiate a go-around but the aircraft became unstable as he raised the nose slipped to the left and stalled the plane. The No.1 engine hit the ground first, 200 meters from the airport.", "During the approach to airplane was high above the glide slope. At an altitude of 250 m, 4 km from the runway, the crew added takeoff power and performed  a missed approach. Simultaneously  the right engine lost power. While the crew tried to feather the propeller, the aircraft lost altitude, rolled 40 degrees to the right and struck a snow-covered field about 500 m from the runway."]}
