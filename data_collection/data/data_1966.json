The KC-135 was completely destroyed when its fuel load ignited, killing all four crew members. The B-52G broke apart, killing three of the seven crew members aboard.\nAt the time of the accident, the B-52G was carrying four B28FI Mod 2 Y1 thermonuclear (hydrogen) bombs, all of which fell to the surface. Three were found on land near the small fishing village of Palomares in the municipality of Cuevas del Almanzora, Almer\u00eda, Spain. The non-nuclear explosives in two of the weapons detonated upon impact with the ground, resulting in the contamination of a 0.77-square-mile area with radioactive plutonium.

Lake Michigan 8/16/65, Cincinnati 11/8/65, Salt Lake City 11/11/65 and Tokyo Bay 2/4/66. Only the Salt Lake and Cincinnati crashes were officially attributed to it. After 727 training manuals were modified and pilots were reoriented to the flying characteristics of the aircraft the problem was corrected.", "Crashed into high terrain, 12 miles west of its proper course, due to a navigation error. Abandonment of the ILS approach at too early a stage during an attempt to land under conditions of poor visibility in fog.", "Undershot the runway and struck a concrete obstruction in poor weather conditions. Lack of information supplied to the pilot regarding the true conditions of surface visibility which was below the minimum prescribed for a night landing.  Lack of proper monitoring and possibly incorrect setting of altimeters during the approach to land. The use of landing lights which resulted in glare during the final stages of the approach in foggy conditions", "An hour after he departed Vorkuta Airport bound for Syktyvkar, the crew reported a fire on the right engine. After the engine detached, the plane crashed in a lake. The right engine number five cylinder broke in flight, which resulted in the breaking of the connecting rod and the failure of the cylinders number three and seven. The destruction of these three cylinders caused the hydraulic fluid to be ejected from the crankcase through the exhaust manifold, causing a violent fire that the crew was unable to extinguish.", "The crew was attempted a night takeoff in heavy snow. The plane veered off the runway to the right and crashed in flames. The crew attempted a takeoff in what was well below the minima. It was determined that the crew decided to attempt to takeoff with a visibility limited to 1,000 meters due to fog and snow, which was well below the minima. In such conditions, the aircraft was not properly aligned on the runway centerline, causing the left main gear to struck a snow wall. Investigators believe that Sheremetyevo Airport officials also bear some responsibilities for the accident because they failed to take the appropriate actions to ensure that the runway was properly cleared of snow.", "The cargo plane struck trees to the right of the runway while attempting to land. On board were 167 head of calves. Failure of the pilot to comply with the Company's minima. Subsequent belated decision to execute the missed approach procedure.", "The aircraft struck the approach lights and a sea wall during a landing attempt. The pilot initiated a steep rate of descent with the intention of executing a final approach at a lower altitude. Poor visibility due to illusive fog conditions misled the pilot and affected his judgement. The day after the accident, a helicopter searching for bodies in Tokyo Bay also crashed into the bay, killing 2 of 5 crew.", "The aircraft crashed into Mt. Fuji after encountering severe turbulence when the pilot decided to give the passengers a view of the mountain. The aircraft encountered severe clear air turbulence and started to come apart in the air before crashing.", "The cargo plane flew into Mt. Parnon about 27 km east of Sparta.", "On approach, the aircraft struck power cables, stalled and crashed into the Portland Canal. after the pilot misjudged altitude and clearance. VFR flight into adverse weather conditiions.", "Crashed into sand dunes. Improper approach during a sandstorm with turbulence and icing. Descent of the aircraft below the safe flight altitude in the final approach.", "The cargo plane crashed on takeoff.", "The aircraft crashed into foothills during landing attempt at Ardmore Municipal Airport . During the approach in rain and fog, the captain made a last-minute change in his choice of runways. One minute later the plane crashed into high ground. Incapacitation of the captain with a heart attack during final stages of approach.  The captain, who suffered from a long standing heart condition and diabetes, managed to keep his pilot's license by falsifying his medical records.", "The pilot reported both engine were losing power and he was going to ditch the plane into the ocean. Engine failure cause unknown. The wreckage was never found.", "Crashed into 12,600 ft. Mt. Talsula. Pilot error. Incorrectly selected the route. Incorrectly calculated the climb performance of the aircraft in relation to its total weight of takeoff. Underestimated the elevation of peaks he had to clear along the route.", "Engine failure caused the helicopter to crash shortly after taking off. Failure of the aircraft's No. 2 pinion drive shaft thrust bearing.", "Contact with the cargo plane was lost en route. Wreckage found  3 days later. Cause undetermined.", "Cashed in poor weather. Misjudgment of the terrain clearance, which resulted in the collision with trees in severe turbulence and strong gusty winds.", "The incurrence of reverse thrust during simulated failure of no. 4 engine on takeoff. That condition arose when very rapid rearward movement of the power level generated an inertia force which caused the associated thrust brake lever to rise and enter the reverse idle detent. After lift-off, the minimum control speed essentially required to overcome the prevailing state of thrust imbalance was never attained and an uncontrollable roll, accompanied by some degree of yaw and sideslip in the same direction, ensued. When the condition of reverse thrust was recognized and eliminated, insufficient time and height were available to allow the aircraft to recover from its precarious attitude before it struck the ground.", "While cruising in poor weather conditions, the cargo plane struck the slope of Mt Planch\u00f3n-Peteroa  located about 200 km south of Santiago.plane. The wreckage was never found.", "Struck mountain slope while in level flight. VFR flight into adverse weather conditions.

Both engines failed as the approach continued. The plane came to rest in a shallow pond on the golf course. Fuel starvation. Mismanagement of  fuel. Pro golfer Tony Lema and his wife, Betty, was killed. He was on a Buick promotional tour.", "The cargo  aircraft was not being flown at the recommended altitude when it reached mountains to be crossed, nor whas it at the proper crossing point. A secondary factor was the lack of navigational aids in the area.", "The aircraft broke up in flight due to turbulence after entering a squall line. Right tailplane and wing failed. Pilot operated aircraft in area of avoidable weather hazard.", "Crashed on a flight while en route.", "Ditched in the ocean after running out of fuel after a problem caused excessive fuel consumption. Decision to continue a flight with both engines impaired until ditching at night became inevitable, instead of making an emergency daytime landing on any of the various runways in the area at a time when the situation made it clear that this operation was inevitable.", "Following engine failure, the jet fighter crashed into a village.", "Crashed into a glacial crevasse near Juneau. Undetermined cause.", "The plane crashed into forest during a landing attempt at Ljubljana Airport. The crew's failure to follow proper landing procedures. Improperly set altimeter.

The plane sank after 5 minutes.  One passenger refused to leave the aircraft and drowned.", "The cargo plane struck trees at the end of the runway after trying to make an emergency landing. Material failure consisting in fatigue failure of a number of teeth of the pinion of the governor control unit, which was jammed against the rack in the 'up' position and therefore set for maximum rpm, thus causing the engine to overspeed. This would be in keeping with the fact that the dome ring was at maximum low pitch setting, i.e. high rpm and a runway propeller on take-off.", "About 150 miles from Longreach, fire was reported in No. 1 and 2 engines. While the plane was making an emergency descent, the left wing broke away due to weakening by the fire. After failure of the wing, the plane broke up in mid-air and crashed. Loosened bolts led to the loss of the oil lubricating unit causing the bearings to heat and catching the engines on fire. Subsequently, a locking mechanism was installed on the bolts to prevent any future accidents of this kind.", "The plane crashed into Salmon Mountain while on approach to Portland. The pilots evidently had agreed to maintain 9,000 feet, but descended instead. The aircraft hit the mountain at the 3,830-foot level of a 4,090-foot ridge.
