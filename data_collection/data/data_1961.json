Detonation of a nitrocellulose bomb.", "After a night takeoff, while climbing to a height of 500 feet, the airplane went out of control and crashed in a wooded area.", "Lost an engine, stalled and crashed.", "Five minutes after taking off from Lisbon, Portugal, the aircraft plunged into the Atlantic Ocean. There were indications from the wreckage that the aircraft went into a spiral dive and hit the water at over 500 mph. Either through inattentiveness or loss of an artificial horizon or other instrument malfunction, the aircraft went into a steep left bank from which recovery was not possible. Attitude of the aircraft at the moment of impact pointed to over correction.", "Crashed into a hill  at night during the approach, 4 km short of the runway. Crew's neglect to cockpit duties. Pilot's inattention to his instruments.", "After liftoff, the airplane encountered difficulties in gaining height when the propeller on the No 2 engine struck a tree located 1,200 meters past the runway end. The airplane continued at low height and struck a second tree, causing a fuel tank to be ruptured and to catch fire. The accident was caused by flight at too low an altitude during a night training exercise.", "Error in judgement on the part of the captain, who, after sighting the runway lights, concentrated on keeping them in sight and failed to make adequate reference to his flight instruments. As a result, he allowed the aircraft to descend below the obstacle clearance limit of 360ft.  In the darkness, with no ground reference, the runway lights gave him insufficient guidance as to his height and angle of approach and he was unaware that the aircraft had descended to ground level. The fatigue of the captain and the failure to illuminate the aircraft's landing lights were conributing factors.", "Crashed into a trees and telegraph poles on final approach.The pilot failed to follow the instrument approach procedures during the approach.", "The plane ran out of fuel and crash landed. Crew did not refuel at Kazan.", "Hit apporach lights while trying to land in heavy rain.", "Following takeoff from Omaha, hydraulic difficulties were experienced. The flight was continued to Denver where the aircraft experienced asymmetrical reverse thrust while landing and crashed into a maintenance truck and burned. Asymmetrical thrust during the landing attempt due to a hydraulic emergency.  Numbers 1 & 2 thrust reversers failed.  The crew failed to activate the back-up high-pressure air bottle used to hold the reverse ejectors in the extended position during a hydraulic emergency.  Poor evacuation procedures.  A contributing factor was the  failure of the first officer to monitor the thrust reverse indicator lights when applying reverse thrust and the crew's lack of training and knowledge on the aircraft's hydraulic system. The driver of the maintenance truck was killed.", " On reaching Rabat, the plane was diverted to Casablanca because of poor ground visibility. Conditions at Casablanca were a little better but the plane overshot the runway on its first approach. With worsening conditions the pilot asked to land at the U.S. Air Force base at Nouasseur. While the tower was seeking permission, the pilot saw a window of opportunity and tried again to land at Casablanca. The aircraft crashed into a hillside and burned eight miles short of the runway.", "The aircraft disintegrated in flight following the application of loads in excess of the design loads. The aircraft entered an area of extreme turbulence and was struck by lightning.", "Undershot the runway by 200 feet, crashed and burned. Absence of approach and runway lights. Lack of guidance from air traffic controller during last stages of flight.", "The aircraft crashed between a row of houses while on a sightseeing flight. Inattention of crew to duties. Pilots had 2 companions in the cabin during the entire flight and performed forbidden maneuvers including one sharp turn which resulted in  lost control of the aircraft.", "Crashed into a mountain18 nm northeast of Stravanger Airport.  Deviation from prescribed course. Cause unknown.", "An in-flight fire, initiated and sustained by a severe fuel leak. The fuel leak was caused by the locking of a carburetor drain plug to unscrew.", "The aircraft crashed and burned in a field 10 miles west of Midway Airport. The airliner had taken off from Midway headed for Las Vegas. Loss of a 5/16 inch steel bolt from the elevator boost system which caused the elevator to move to its full upward position creating a stall and loss of control of the aircraft.", "Malfunctioning propeller. The pilot tried to turn back for an emergency landing but  the plane stalled and crashed.", "The aircraft crashed into high terrain, 1,500 meters short of the runway in adverse weather conditions. Probable cause: Continuation of visual filght in adverse weather conditions.", "Cargo plane crashed.", "The aircraft crashed into the Shannon River shortly after taking off in fog. Possible fault with the artificial horizon or aircraft's aileron tabs. Contributing factor was the weather and crew fatigue.", "The aircraft crashed and burned while attempting to land at Sale Airport. With its landing gear down and flaps partially extended, the plane struck the ground in a slight nose-down attitude. Possible misread altimeter.", "The aircraft crashed into the jungle approximately 9 miles from the destination airport. UN Secretary General, Dag Hammarskj\u00f6ld, 56, killed. The aircraft was allowed to descend too low, resulting in striking trees and crashing. Although the United Nations released a statement that no evidence of sabotage was found, rumors persist about this accident alleging that the victims were shot prior to the crash or that a bomb onboard exploded. A recent report in 2011 sites pilot fatigue as the cause of the accident.", "Takeoff and Initial climb appeared to be normal, but at approximately 200 feet a shallow turn to the right continued into a gradually increasing bank of about 85 to 90 degrees. While in the turn, the crew made a short, garbled transmission indicating alarm. During the latter part of the turn a gradual descent began and, two minutes after taking off, the aircraft struck the ground. Mechanical failure in the aileron primary control system due to an improper replacement of the aileron boost assembly, resulting in a loss of lateral control of the aircraft at an altitude too low to effect recovery.", "Crashed into high terrain on approach, 18 kms from Ankara Airport. The aircraft was not in a normal flying  pattern and below normal altitude.", "Crashed into Mt. Canigou while descending to land. Navigational error.", "The plane stalled and crashed during takeoff.", "Failed to gain altitude after a missed approach and crashed. The malfunctioning of the automatic pitch coarsening unit of the starboard propeller. This deprived the captain of the necessary degree of control of the aircraft at a critical stage of the flight.", "The flight crashed into a hill during approach. Pilot error. Improper evaluation of distance, flying a non-standard traffic pattern by night and failing to observe altitude minima during the final approach.", "Flown under a military contract, several procedural errors by the crew caused the loss of 2 engines. After several more errors, the aircraft crashed into a wooded area. Most deaths from post-impact fire and CO.  Lack of command coordination and decision, faulty judgement and insufficient knowledge that led to an emergency situation. In addition there were faulty maintenance procedures. The carrier's license was revoked 6 weeks after the crash.", "Went missing en route in the Caribbean Sea.", "The pilot flew too close to the summit of Mt Ruapehu and due either to turbulence or some pilot maneuver, the starboard propeller struck a rock outcrop on the mountain, bending the blade tips forward and causing vibration, which weakened the wing and led to its rapid structural failure of the aircraft.", "The aircraft was on a charter flight to Livingstone to pick up United Nations troops on leave and take them back to Elizabethville. It took off from Salisbury Airport, and shortly after take-off suddenly dipped its right wing. After a slow recovery, it climbed away to between 100 - 150 ft and then went into a turn to the left with the port propeller windmilling. This turn continued to get steeper until the aircraft rolled over and dived inverted to the ground . The accident was caused by failure of the pilot to execute a successful single engine forced landing after concluding that there had been a power loss in the port engine. Evidence indicated that a failure of the port engine did not, in fact, occur. The pre-take-off rudder trimmer check was not carried out correctly as laid down in the checklist, and the aircraft took off with full left rudder trim applied. Once airborne this was misinterpreted as port engine failure, and the port propeller was feathered. No apparent action was taken by the pilot to correct the ensuing critical speed yaw.", "?", "After reaching an altitude of about 100 m, the aircraft lost altitude, collided with a eucalyptus forest and was destroyed. Pilot error. Failure to operate under IFR in adverse weather conditions at night.

Shifting cargo.", "The plane made an unconcrolled dive and crashed into a snow covered field. The flight engineer inadvertently caused the flaps to be selected to 40 degrees.", "Shortly after taking off from Esenboga Airport, the aircraft assumed an excessively steep climbing angle, stalled and crashed. The probable cause of the accident was the obstruction of the pitch pointer in the captain's director horizon which led him to make an excessively steep climb. One of three screws had worked its way loose and blocked the pointer on the dial from indicating the correct pitch.", "Crashed shortly after initial lift-off while making a water takeoff from Old Harbor. Improperly executed takeoff  \nwhich resulted in an inadvertent descent into the water. This produced a high-speed low-angle porpoising from which the pilot was unable to recover.", "On approach to Surabaya Airport, the plane struck a mountain.", "The plane crashed about 3 km southwest of the airport on a second attempt to land at Mineral Waters.
