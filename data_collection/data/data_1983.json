As the flight crew kept trying heavy control inputs, they worked the cables loose enough to regain some control. Diverting to Anchorage, they were barely able to descend by stopping a second engine.

U.S. Representative from Georgia Lawrence McDonald killed. Because of an improper navigational setting the plane drifted off course. There was a U.S. spy plane in the vacinity of the 007 flight. The 007 plane was mistaken for the spy plane. The fighter pilot was ordered by Soviet command to shoot down the plane. Two air-to-air missiles were launched by the  fighter and struck the Boeing 747.

The nosegear and one of the main landing gear legs broke away from the fuselage and the aircraft caught fire.", "While attempting to land at Madrid, the crew intercepted the wrong ILS track which caused the pilot to initiate a right turn short of the VOR beacon. The aircraft impacted a series of hills during which the right wing broke off, the aircraft cartwheeled and broke into 5 pieces and came to rest upside down. Procedural errors by the crew including the pilot not knowing his precise position before descending, failure of the crew to take corrective action after a warning from the  ground proximity warning system and deficient teamwork on the flight deck.  The aircraft was named \"Magnus Viking,\" LN-RNA and dry-leased from SAS.", "The aircraft crashed 18 nm short of the runway after attaining a nose-high attitude in poor visibility and caught fire. Crew may have been preoccupied with landing gear trouble.", "While taking off, the B-727 struck the DC-9 on the runway in poor visibility, fog and snow. Because of poor visibility and inadequate signs and markings the, DC-9 inadvertently wandered on the runway being used by the B-727 to take off. The airport had no ground radar. Fifty-one aboard the 727 and all 42 aboard the DC-9 were killed. Mexican actress,  Mar\u00eda \"Fanny Cano\" Dami\u00e1n, 39, among those killed.", "After liftoff, the aircraft entered a 90 degree bank, struck power lines and crashed into buildings. Failure of the No.3 engine during a climb out with the No.4 engine operating at idle.", "The left wing contacted the ground after the pilot attempted a go-around. The plane cartwheeled and crashed. Runway is not oriented to correspond with the prevailing winds. The aircraft was overloaded by 840 lbs and was below that prescribed to take off. Lack of weather forcast.", "The airliner crashed on approach in adverse weather. Instead of a go-around the pilot put the plane in a tight turn to the right with a high slip angle, leading to a loss of airspeed. After descending through decision height the pilot attempted a go-around but the plane rolled to the left and lost altitude. After the bank angle reached 90 degrees the aircraft crashed short of  the runway."]}
