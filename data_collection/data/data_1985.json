U.S. Navy diver Robert Stethem was murdered aboard.", "The plane stalled and crashed into an emergency vehicle while making an emergency landing attempt after an engine caught fire. A faulty fuel injection nozzle caused a blow torch effect damaging the compressor turbine vane ring and causing thermal fatigue and loss of one of the turbine blades.The resulting imbalance ruptured the starting control bypass fuel return line.", "The aircraft broke up in flight and crashed into the ocean. Detonation of an explosive device in the forward cargo hold. Terrorist working in Vancouver, Canada, checked baggage with bombs onto two flights. One bag transferred at Toronto onto flight 182. The other would have been transferred at Tokyo onto another Air India flight, but exploded at the airport killing 2 baggage handlers. The aircraft was named \" Emperor Kanishka.\"", "The crew climbed to the cruising altitude of FL380  at an airspeed of which is close to stall speed. During cruise flight vibrations started because of the low airspeed but were assumed by the crew to be  caused by engine surges. They reduced power to idle, causing the airspeed to drop. Trying to maintain altitude, the airplane eventually stalled, went into a flat spin and crashed.", "Crashed into the Amazon jungle in poor weather, after the crew reported a fire in the No. 3 engine. The last words from the aircraft was \"We're falling.\"", "While on a flight from Fort Lauderdale, FL to Dallas/ Forth Worth, the aircraft crashed while making an landing attempt in thunderstorm activity. The plane touched down 6,000 feet short of the runway and 360 feet to the left of the runway centerline, became airborne again, struck a car killing the driver, crossed the highway and crashed into two water tank reservoirs. Microburst induced windshear. The flightcrew's decision to initiate and continue the approach into a cumulonimbus cloud which they observed to contain lightning. Lack of training for avoiding and escaping from low-altitude windshear.", "The aircraft suffered an aft pressure bulkhead failure at 23,900 ft. The aircraft had severe control difficulties with loss of all controls and eventually after 40 minutes, collided with a mountain. Improper repair of the  bulkhead while being supervised by Boeing engineers after a tail strike in 1978. Worst single plane disaster in aviation history. Kyu Sakamoto, 43, famous for his Japanese song \"Sukiyaki\" was killed in the accident.", "Unknown circumstances.", "As the plane reached FL230, water was spilled on the autopilot panel and the crew had to disengage the autopilot because the stabilizer trim wheel started to rotate. Control was lost as the plane pitched up and down. Control was regained at 1,000 ft. and an emergency landing was carried out.", "During takeoff from Manchester, failure of the No. 9 combustor on the port engine resulted in its ejection from the engine and fracturing of the fuel tank access panel and resulting fire. The fire spread into the cabin incapacitating and killing passengers due to toxic smoke. Thermal metal fatigue of the combustor. Slow braking, using reverse thrust and turning the aircraft so it stopped with fire upwind of the fuselage, all helped to feed the flames. The front starboard side door was farthest from flames but jammed when there was a partial premature chute deployment, and  the crew spent time trying to unjam it, while toxic smoke accumulated in the cabin, before starting evacuations through port side door.\n The aircraft was named \"River Orrin.\"", "While on approach, ATC noticed the flight was east of course and the crew was given instructions to correct.   The crew then tried, unsuccessfully to intercept the glideslope. The plane struck trees and crashed short and right of the runway centerline. The pilot's continuation of an unstabilized approach which resulted in a descent below glideslope. Improper IFR procedure by pilot. Missed approach not performed. Decision height not identified. Samantha Smith, 13, along with her father were killed. She became famous for writing to Soviet leader Yuri Andropov about her fear of nuclear war. She later visited him in Moscow.", "Crashed while trying to land with 3 engines.", "Shot down by rebels with a ground-to-air missile while flying at FL130.", "The aircraft stalled and dove into the ground as it  took off.  Failure of right engine after compressor spacer failure precipitated by a fatigue crack. The crew's improper use of flight controls in response to the catastrophic failure of the right engine during a critical phase of flight which led to an accelerated stall and loss of control of the airplane. Contributing to the loss of control was a lack of crew coordination in response to the emergency.", "Shot down by Afghan rebels.", "The plane crashed en route after a fire in the No. 1 engine which led to the seperation of the outer wing.", "Lost power and spiraled into the ground after takeoff. Contaminated fuel. Overloaded.", "The pilot of the cargo plane stayed at a low altitude after taking off in IMC conditons and crashed.", "After attaining 5,000 ft. the cargo plane lost control crashed into Botany Bay after taking off from Sydney.", "Crashed into a mountain slope after taking off in bad weather. Instructions to climb normally were delayed because of traffic.", "The cargo plane crashed into mountains while en route.", "The cargo plane struck high ground while en route. Pilot error. Altitude not maintained. Improper clearance.", "The cargo plane overfew the runway and crashed one mile beyond the end.", "Crashed during a test flight. The elevators locked soon after takeoff.", "Crashed into Mt. Sibayak.", "Hijacking. While on the ground at Malta to refuel the aircraft was stormed by Egyptian forces. During the fight, several hand grenades were thrown into the cabin causing a fire.", "Shot down by South African anti-aircraft fire.", "The aircraft stalled and crashed during takeoff. Two-hundred-forty-four members of the 101st Airborne Division from Fort Campbell, Kentucky  were killed in the accident. There is controversy surrounding this crash. The majority opinion of the board was that the cause of the sequence leading up to the stall and crash could not be determined, with icing a possibility. The minority opinion was that the crash was possibly caused by detonation of an explosive device of unknown origin in a cargo compartment which led to an in-flight fire and loss of control of the aircraft.", "Crashed into a forest.", "The plane crash landed into a field and struck a pole then continued into trees after dense smoke filled the plane and cockpit. The fire most likely started in a defective cabin heater but was not determined for sure. Singer Rick Nelson, 45, fianc\u00e9e Helen Blair, 27, soundman Clark Russell and the members of his back-up group The Stone Canyon Band, Andy Chapin, 20, Rick Intveld, 22, Bobby Neal, 38, and Patrick Woodward, 35 were killed. Both pilots survived after climbing out the cockpit windows. Nelson had purchased the DC-3 in May 1985 from Jerry Lee Lewis and the craft had been forced to make two emergency landings in the previous six months. Nelson and his band were en route to perform at the half-time festivities at the Cotton Bowl."]}
