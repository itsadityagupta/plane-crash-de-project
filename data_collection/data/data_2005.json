In addition, there was a thin layer of ice on the aircraft's wings. The flight crew's failure to effectively monitor and maintain airspeed and comply with procedures for deice boot activation on the approach, which caused an aerodynamic stall from which they did not recover. Contributing to the accident was the FAA's failure to establish adequate certification requirements for flight into icing conditions, which led to the inadequate stall warning margin provided by the airplane's stall warning system.", "While on approach to Runway 29 the aircraft crashed on a mountain.", "On final approach, the aircraft crashed into the sea 100 meters off shore, 400 meters short of runway.", "The cargo plane crashed into a wooded area short of the runway and was destroyed.", "While on final approach, the air ambulance crashed into the sea at night and in poor visibility.", "The  Russian turboprop carrying oil workers, crashed into the ground and caught fire while on final approach to Varandey in heavy fog.

Forty-seven seconds after the cross flow was opened, there was a  \"bank angle\" warning, followed by a warning chime that was presumably a warning they were straying from their correct altitude. The autopilot disengaging, probably due to a servo reaching its torque limit. This meant that there was no compensation applied for the rudder trim input, and the plane entered a roll and steep descent, disintegrating around FL 199. The investigation found poor visibility at night in low cloud was a factor in preventing the pilots realizing sooner.", "The plane was heading for the town of Isiro when it lost radio contact.

There was severe thunderstorms at the time of the landing with rain, lightning and hail. All 309 aboard escaped. There were 43 injuries. The pilot landed the plane too far down the rain-slick runway making it virtually impossible to stop the plane before it ran off the runway. In addition, the reverse thrust was not employed until 17 seconds after the wheels touched down.", "The aircraft developed engine trouble while en route from Bari Italy to Djerba, Tunisia The crew contacted Palermo ATC for an emergency landing but ditched into the sea approximately 19 miles north of Palermo. The pilot reported that both engines had failed. Fuel starvation. The maintenance crew incorrectly installed a fuel gauge for a ATR-42 on the ATR-72. Both instruments look very similar. A contributing factor was the failure of the crew to carry out proper emergency procedures once the plane ran out of fuel. In March 2009, an Italian court sentenced the pilot, to 10 years of jail for manslaughter. Prosecutors said that after the plane's engines stopped functioning, Garbi failed to follow emergency procedures, and that he could possibly have reached runway 25 of Palermo \"Punta Raisi\" Airport, or even the standard runway 20. Witnesses say he succumbed to panic and began praying out loud, rather than attempting to maneuver the plane to the nearest airport.", "The helicopter crashed at sea about 3 miles off the coast near the island of Naissaar, after disappeared from Tallinn ATC radar 3 minutes after take-off from Tallinn in gusty wind conditions. Failure of the power steering system, caused by coating flaking off from servo pistons. The loosened plasma coating flakes blocked the return valves of the servos, causing the aircraft to abruptly lose its maneuverability", "While flying at FL340 towards Athens the crew reported problems with their air conditioning system. As the airliner entered Greek airspace ATC lost contact with the plane. Two Greek F-16 fighters were dispatched to intercept the plane. The F-16 pilots reported that one pilot was not in the cockpit and the other was slumped over the controls. They also said oxygen masks had deployed in the cabin. The plane continued on its programmed route to a holding pattern off the coast of Greece and flew in circles for two hours. Meanwhile, at least two flight attendants had stayed awake using portable oxygen bottles but they couldn't get through the locked, terrorist-proof cockpit door. It was only when one engine failed from fuel starvation that the computer-controlled systems aboard the plane unlocked the door. The plane continued on track until it crashed into mountainous terrain about 25 miles north of Athens. CVR tapes showed that a student pilot/flight attendant, Andreas Prodromou, was at the controls of the aircraft and tried to send a Mayday message twice but the radio was set to the wrong frequency. The cabin pressure control had been  left in the manual, instead of auto position by maintenance workers. The error was not picked up by the two pilots during three subsequent check lists. They failed to respond to warnings as oxygen masks fell in the passenger cabin which eventually  led to the two pilots losing consciousness and the plane crashing.", "While en route, the crew reported engine trouble with both engines and planed to divert to Caracas. The plane began losing altitude and eventually crashed in the Sierra de Perija mountains on the Columbian-Venezuelan border. The autopilot might have reduced engine power too much after a rapid climb to FL330, allowing airspeed to bleed off to the point of a stall. Also the data recorder showed that rather than push the nose over to recover from the stall, the pilots held the yoke to their chests all the way to the ground. It has also been suggesting that a buildup of ice inside each engine's PT2 probe was responsible for the accident.", "The plane was about to land at Pucallpa when it ran into strong winds from a tropical storm. The pilot tried to make an emergency landing without its landing gear on a road near the jungle airport. The plane crashed, broke up and caught fire about 2 miles from the airport. Passengers reported heavy turbulence and flames when the plane crashed. The exact cause of the crash is still unknown, but it is believed that the plane was making an emergency landing because of a hailstorm.", "Seconds after taking off the jetliner shook violently, veered to the left and crashed into a residential neighborhood 500 yards past the end of the runway. It is speculated that the plane was overloaded.", "While on approach to Runway 31 the plane hit trees, crashed and burned.", "While en route, a witness saw the plane lose altitude and crash to the ground and disintegrate into pieces north of Brazzaville.

Two passengers were killed when they exited the plane and ran into the propellers which were still turning.", "The tower lost sight and contact with the plane about five minutes after taking off from Murtala Muhammad International  airport. The plane crashed about 30 miles north of Lagos.  A storm was passing through the airport at about the time the aircraft took off. A combination of poor maintenance of the plane by the ground crew together with a lightning strike to the right wing of the plane caused the right engine to ignite, causing the aircraft to bank heavily to the left and eventually lose control.", "The military plane crashed into an apartment building in the Azari district after taking off from Mehrabad Airport. The plane suffered engine failure and was attempting to return for a emergency landing.", "The jetliner slid off Runway 13C at Chicago's Midway Airport, went through an airport boundary fence and crashed into two vehicles at a nearby intersection, killing a young 6- year-old boy. Heavy snow was falling at the time of the accident. The plane had circled the airport for 30 to 35 minutes before attempting to land. The pilots' failure to use available reverse thrust in a timely manner to safely slow or stop the airplane after landing, which resulted in a runway overrun. This failure occurred because the pilots' first experience and lack of familiarity with the airplane's autobrake system distracted them from thrust reverser usage during the challenging landing. Contributing to the accident were Southwest Airline's 1) failure to provide its pilots with clear and consistent guidance and training regarding company policies and procedures related to arrival landing distance calculations; 2) programming and design of its onboard performance computer, which did not present inherent assumptions in the program critical to pilot decision making; 3) plan to implement new autobrake procedures without a familiarization period; and 4) failure to include a margin of safety in the arrival assessment to account for operational uncertainties. Also contributing to the accident was the pilots' failure to divert to another airport given reports that included poor braking action and a tailwind component greater than 5 knots. Contributing to the severity of the accident was the absence of an engineering materials arresting system, which was needed because of the limited runway safety area beyond the departure end of runway 31C.", "The plane crash-landed and burst into flames in a lightning storm while attempting to land at Port Harcourt Airport. Pilot error. The crew's decision to continue to approach below the decision altitude without having the runway in sight.  It was recommended to improve the training of Nigerian pilots to recognize and recover from adverse weather conditions including windshear. Also, airports and aircraft should be equipped with instruments to detect windshear. In addition, it was recommended that airports and aircraft be equipped with instruments to detect windshear.", "The seaplane crashed off Miami Beach next to a jetty as it was taking off. There was an explosion and fire and the right wing separated prior to the plane impacting the water. Examination of the wreckage revealed fatigue cracks in the right wing. The failure of Chalk's Ocean Airways' maintenance program to identify and properly repair fatigue cracks in the wing, and the failure of the FAA to detect and correct deficiencies in the company's maintenance program. Although a 16-inch crack in the wing had been patched, a more significant flaw in a nearby support beam hadn't been repaired. The carrier had no record of patching the crack.", "The plane crashed along the shore of the Caspian Sea 8 minutes after taking off from Baku. Instrument failure left the crew unable to control the aircraft."]}
