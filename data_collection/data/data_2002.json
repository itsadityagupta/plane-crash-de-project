The crew made an emergency landing in the Bengawan Solo River, in shallow water. The plane circled several times before diving in a steep course towards the river. The plane's left wing struck a river bank before it plunged into the water. The reason the crew flew into extreme weather was the heavy rain and hail was shadowed on the radar and blocked from radar view. In addition, the airplane had a partially failed battery which was exhausted by two attempts to restart the engines, producing a total electrical failure.

The pilot's decision to initiate and continue the flight towards Tulc\u00e1n Airport while below minimum meteorological conditions established in the company's standard operating procedure.  Inadequate navigation and operation of the aircraft by the pilot in command consistent with entering the holding pattern at the Tulc\u00e1n NDB with a velocity of 230 knots indicated and with a bank angle of 15 degrees, exceeding the maximum limit of 180 knots stipulated throughout the procedure, and using a bank angle inferior to the recommended 25 to 30 degrees, thereby departing holding pattern obstacle protection, leading to a collision against the Cumbal Volcano.", "Crashed against the side of a mountain in heavy fog in the Sefid Kouh mountain range while on approach to Khorramabad.

Pilot error.", "The cargo plane crashed while attempting to make an emergency landing.", "The plane was making an emergency landing after two previous attempts in heavy snow and strong winds when it clipped treetops and crashed into a field, approximately 1.5km short of the runway.", "A helicopter ferrying U.S. troops in a counter-terrorism exercise, crashed into the sea, 30 minutes before its scheduled arrival at Mactan Island.

The crew did not conform to the VFR that required a track change to maintain the required flight parameters and/or a diversion to a suitable alternate airport.", "While en-route, 35 minutes into the flight, the bi-plane crashed near Santa Clara. The plane was seen spinning out of control before it hit the ground. A strong gust of wind, possibly a small tornado, tore off the top part of the left wing.", "The cargo plane crashed into the ocean while on approach to Runway 27.", "The cargo plane crashed into lights near the runway threshold while attempting to land on Runway 24L.", "The aircraft crashed onto a mountain, in fog, wind and rain while attempting to land at Kimhae Airport. A strong southerly wind required the aircraft to make a turn and approach the runway from the north. The aircraft crashed near the peak of Mt. Mulbong, approximately 3 mile north of the runway. The plane bounced three times before hitting the ground and exploding. More than 1,000 trees were uprooted by the impact. The plane was off course when the crew turned on final. The flight crew performed the circling approach, not being aware of the weather minima of wide-body aircraft (B767-200) for landing, and in the approach briefing, did not include the missed approach, etc., among the items specified in Air China\u0092s operations and training manuals. \nThe flight crew exercised poor crew resource management and lost situational awareness during the circling approach to runway 18R, which led them to fly outside of the circling approach area, delaying the base turn, contrary to the captain\u0092s intention to make a timely base turn. The flight crew did not execute a missed approach when they lost sight of the runway during the circling approach to runway 18R, which led them to strike high terrain (mountain) near the airport. When the first officer advised the captain to ascend again for landing, about 5 seconds before impact, the captain did not react, nor did the first officer initiate the missed approach himself.", "The plane was being used by the Penitentiary and Prison National Institute, Inpec, to fly prisoners from Medell\u00edn to Popay\u00e1n.

Debris was spread across a 20 mile radius. Fifty-two children on a beach holiday were among the 69 aboard the Tupolev. The Tupolev pilot received contradictory instructions. The collision avoidance warning system (TCAS) told the pilot to ascend followed by an order from the Swiss air traffic controller to descend one second later. The Russian plane did not immediately respond to the tower's order to descend, so he repeated the command 14 seconds later. Thirty seconds later the two planes collided. The Tupolev's TCAS was telling the pilots to ascend. The Boeing's TCAS was telling the pilots to descend. The Swiss air traffic controller was telling the Tupolev's pilots to descend. The air traffic controller that guided the planes had no way of knowing the Russian pilot was receiving contradictory instruction from his cockpit TCAS unless told so by the pilot. Russian aviation officials said the pilot correctly gave precedence to the control tower, but Western aviation experts said pilots are trained to give precedence to the cockpit warning. In addition, the controller was left alone on duty while his partner went on a break and was preoccupied with another aircraft. This was accepted policy at Skyguide, the Swiss air control company. In addition, maintenance crews, working on the computer system, limited the controller's information he was receiving including conflict alert warnings. Sadly, one-and-a-half years later, the controller, Peter Nielsen, was stabbed to death by a Russian man who had lost his wife and two children in the accident.", "The aircraft crashed 2 miles short of the runway into the Guitangola neighborhood of Bangui.
