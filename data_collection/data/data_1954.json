The aircraft was nicknamed \"Yoke Yoke.\"", "Midair collision between a Canadair C-4-1 and a RCAF Harvard Mark II at 6,000 feet.  Thirty-five killed on the Canadair, one on the Harvard. Failure on the part of the pilots of both aircraft to maintain a proper lookout. The onus of responsibility for keeping out of the way being with the Harvard aircraft as it had the other on its own right side.", "Shortly after taking off and climbing the plane crashed near Lake Batuco.", "Stalled and crashed and burned during takeoff.", "Crashed into a mountain during an approach. Deviation from prescribed course for unknown reasons. Crew fatigue may have played a part. The captain acted contrary to company policy regarding a required IFR approach.", "The aircraft tried to return to the airport after the No. 1 engine failed on takeoff but was unable to maintain airspeed, stalled and crashed into a tree. Delay in feathering the No. 1 engine after failure. Improper emergency procedural errors by the pilot.", "Crashed onto a roadway from a height of 500 ft. and into a clump of trees.The crew used the wrong fuel selection configueration and the engines failed due to fuel starvation.", "The aircraft deviated from its normal course by 30 miles and struck the slope of Mt Cip\u00f3a. Navigational error. The minimum safety height for the route was not complied with.", "The cargo plane ran off the end of the runway and crashed after being attacked by a fighter jet.", "The cargo plane crashed on takeoff. Elevator lock was not removed prior to takeoff.", "Crashed en route under unknown circumstances..", "The plane ditched into the Atlantic Ocean after running out of fuel. Three non-swimming passengers drowned due to lack of lifesaving equipment aboard. Negligence of the crew in not monitoring the fuel situation as the flight progressed.", "The aircraft crashed while attempting to take off. Engine failure at a critical stage in takeoff.", "Ditched into the sea after being shot down by Chinese Lachovlin  La-7 military fighter aircraft. The survivors were rescued by the U.S. Air Force.", "The cargo plane flew into a mountain, 35 miles northeast of McGrath.", "Crashed into mountains after poor weather diverted the flight from Santa Maria. Flew opposite to prescribed course after takeoff. Crew error. The failure of the pilot to carry out the normal climb out procedure following takeoff on a flight to Bermuda and his having made a turn to the left instead of to the right, thus flying into the mountains instead of turning out to sea.", "The cargo plane crashed en route.", "Crashed into the Mekong River while making an emergency landing after encountering engine failure. The aircraft was being used to evacuate families.", "The aircraft crashed 16 miles south of Mason City, Iowa due to a loss of control after penetrating an area of thunderstorms during a go-around. The flight, while endeavouring to traverse a thunderstorm area, encountered very heavy rain, divergent winds, and strong downdrafts that forced the aircraft to the ground.", "Crashed into the North Sea in rain showers and heavy seas. Cause not determined.", "The plane crashed in the mountains. Crew did not properly use the navigation equipment.", "Crashed while making practice approaches to Ellsworth Air Force Base during its sixth attempt. The plane slammed into to ground with landing gear retracted and flaps set at 20 degrees.", "Less than a minute after takeoff, the aircraft crashed into a mudbank of the Shannon River. Although the crash site was only about 2,500 metres from the airport, no one was aware of the disaster. Rescue operations were only started after the plane's navigator, after having crossed the river, managed to reach the airport. The aircraft was partially submerged, and at least one of the fuel tanks had ruptured during the crash. The fuel fumes rendered many passengers and crew unconscious, who then drowned in the rising tide. Failure of the captain to interpret his instrument indications properly during flap retraction after the gear was re-extended.", "The plane was attemping to return to the Rio de Janeiro after severe vibrations in the No. 1 engine made the crew feather the prop.  While on final the aircraft came in too high and a go-around was attempted during which the plane crashed into the Guanabara Bay. Lack of reference to instruments after opening the throttle to go-around in restricted visibility.  Power may have been inadvertently reduced on the good engine.", "Stalled and crashed during a test flight.", "Crashed in fog while attempting to land. Crew error, landing in conditions below minimums.", "Crashed in the Alps, 25 miles northeast of Nice, on the French/Italian border while en route. The instrument flight plan the pilot filed indicated a cruising height that was lower than the authorized minimum altitude required to clear the mountains.", "Hit the east slope of Mt Sivukha  located 30 km from the Mana River in strong winds while en route. Crew error.", "The aircraft disappeared approximately 300 miles east of Ocean City, Maryland and no trace of the wreckage or bodies was ever found.", "Crashed during takeoff. An error of judgement on the part of the pilot-in-command in that he took the aircraft into the air at a speed below the minimum control speed, following loss of directional control during the ground run.", "Disappeared over the Andes while en route. Wreckage found 12/04/1954.", "The aircraft crashed during an ILS approach to Berlin. Premature and unauthorized instrument descent to an altitude that did not permit terrain clearance.", "Crashed in the jungle about 30 km north of Luang Prabang on the company's first commercial flight.", "Hit the ground while making an approach to land. It is believed that the Pitot tubes heater system was OFF at the time of the accident, which cause several instruments to display wrong parameters, such the altimeters and the speed indicators.", "The plane crashed into approach lights of the runway during the fourth landing attempt at Idlewild Airport, sinking into Jamaica  Bay. An erratic approach which resulted in a descent to an altitude too low to avoid striking the pier. A contributing factor was pilot fatigue due to the particular and difficult circumstances including two and one-half hours in a holding pattern.", "The cargo plane crashed into a mountain while en route.", "Ditched into the Monongahela River after running out of fuel. Inadequate flight planning. Contributing factors were inadequate crew supervision and training.", "Crashed short of the runway, landing hard. Pilot error. Errors of judgement on the part of the captain in starting his final approach to land at too steep an angle and flaring out too late and too severely with the result that the aircraft sank and hit the ground short of the runway.", "Crashed shortly after takeoff from Irkutsk-Magan Airport."]}
