All passengers survived but one elderly passenger died while waiting for rescue.", "Shot down by a surface-to-air missile during operation Desert Storm.", "The Skywest Metroliner was told to taxi into position for takeoff and hold. The ATC became preoccupied with another aircraft that departed the tower frequency. A Wings West aircraft reporting \"ready for takeoff\", caused some confusion because the controller didn't have a flight progress strip in front of her. The strip appeared to have been misfiled at the clearance delivery position. The USAir, which was cleared to land, struck the rear of the Metroliner. After the collision, both planes slid off the runway into an unoccupied fire station and burst into flames.The failure of the Los Angeles Air Traffic facility management to implement procedures that provided redundancy comparable to the requirements contained in the National Operational Position Standards and the failure of the FAA ATS to provide adequate policy direction and oversight to its ATC facility managers. These failures created an environment in the Los Angeles ATC tower that ultimately led to the failure of the  controller to maintain awareness of the traffic situation, culminating in the inappropriate clearances and the subsequent collision of the USAir and SkyWest aircraft. Twenty-two killed aboard the USAir and all 12 aboard the Metroliner.

John Heinz III was killed in the crash along with two children playing outside an elementary school. Two killed aboard the Bell and 3 aboard the Piper. The poor judgment by the captain of the airplane to permit the in-flight inspection after he had determined to the best of his ability that the nose landing gear was fully extended. The poor judgment of the captain of the helicopter to conduct the inspection and the failure of the flight crew of the helicopter to maintain safe separation.", "Just after turning onto final approach, the aircraft suddenly rolled left until the wings were perpendicular to the ground and crashed in a nose down attitude 2 miles short of  the runway. Malfunction of the left engine propeller control unit which allowed the propeller blade angle to go below the flight idle position.

Loss of hydraulics and electrical systems after a fire, started in the wheel when two tires disintegrated due to under inflation of one tire. This caused a fire which ignited years of accumulated flammables in the DC-8's wheel well leading to an uncontroable fire. The plane was allowed to leave with an under inflated tire.
