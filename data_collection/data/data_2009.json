Preliminary evidence suggests the crew selected the landing gear down and set the flaps 15 degrees. Immediately after selecting the flaps the stick shaker activated. The captain then pulled on the controls, slowing the airplane even further causing the plane to stall. Colgan Air officials acknowledged that both pilots apparently were not paying close attention to the aircraft's instruments and failed to follow the airline's procedures for handling an impending stall in the final minutes of the flight. The captain\u0092s inappropriate response to the activation of the stick shaker, which led to an aerodynamic stall from which the airplane did not recover. Contributing to the accident were (1) the flight crew\u0092s failure to monitor airspeed in relation to the rising position of the low-speed cue, (2) the flight crew\u0092s failure to adhere to sterile cockpit procedures, (3) the captain\u0092s failure to effectively manage the flight, and (4) Colgan Air\u0092s inadequate procedures for airspeed selection and management during approaches in icing conditions.", "The helicopter was carrying firemen to a nearby forest fire when it crashed into a fog shrouded mountain killing all aboard.", "While attemping to take off from Luxor, the cargo plane slammed to the ground, slid down the runway and caught fire.", "The plane was on final approach to Runway 18R when it crashed 1 mile short of the runway into a field and broke in three.

The plane took a nosedive and crashed near Holy Cross cemetery. The plane was carrying children and adults from California to a skiing vacation in Montana when it diverted from its planned destination of Bozeman to Butte. The pilot, who did not use a required anti-ice additive in the fuel,continued to fly despite a deteriorating fuel system. In addition, the plane was 600 pounds over it's take-off weight.", "The fatigued pilot flying the cargo plane flared too late on landing. From his position in the cockpit he was then apparently unable to tell that the main gear had bounced and the tail was rising, so he pitched the plane down to bring the nose to the ground, instead of up to recover from the bounce.

The plane departed from Rio de Janeiro-Galeao International Airport at 19:03 LT bound for Charles de Gaulle Airport in Paris. The last radio contact with the flight was at 01:33 UTC.  The aircraft left CINDACTA III radar coverage at 01:48 UTC, flying normally at FL350. The aircraft reportedly went through a thunderstorm with strong turbulence at 02:00 UTC. At 02:14 UTC an automated message was received indicating a failure of the electrical system. The plane carried 12 crew members and 216 passengers. The wreckage was finally discovered on April 3, 2011 using unmanned submarines.  Flight447 passed into clouds associated with a large system of thunderstorms, its speed sensors became iced over, and the autopilot disengaged. In the ensuing confusion, the pilots lost control of the airplane because they reacted incorrectly to the loss of instrumentation and then seemed unable to comprehend the nature of the problems they had caused. Neither weather nor malfunction doomed flight, nor a complex chain of error, but a simple but persistent mistake on the part of one of the pilots. \n  The crew did not realize the plane was in a stall, were insufficiently trained in flying manually, and never informed the passengers that anything was wrong before they plunged into the sea. The captain was on a rest break when the warnings began. The two co-pilots were facing faulty speed readings from unreliable sensors and repeated alarm signals, but fail to explain why the pilots responded the way they did. It's unclear why the co-pilot at the controls maintained a nose-up input - contrary to the normal procedure to come out of an aerodynamic stall. Normally, the nose should be pointed slightly downward to regain lift in such a stall, often caused because the plane is traveling too slowly. A basic maneuver for stall recovery, which pilots are taught at the outset of their flight training, is to push the yoke forward and apply full throttle to lower the nose of the plane and build up speed. The report confirms that external speed sensors obstructed by ice crystals produced irregular speed readings on the plane. Since the accident, Air France has replaced the speed monitors on all its Airbus A330 and A340 aircraft. The BEA said neither of the co-pilots at the controls had received recent training for manual aircraft handling, or had any high-altitude schooling in case of unreliable air speed readings. A stall warning sounded numerous times, and once for a full 54 seconds, but the crew made no reference to it in cockpit exchanges before the jet crashed.", "The air ambulance crashed into hills while attempting to land in heavy fog about 4 miles from the airport.", "The military transport went missing while en route and might have crashed due to heavy rain in the mountainous region.", "While en route and nearing it's destination, the cargo plane crashed into a 9,600 ft. mountain in the Tangma district.", "The plane crashed into the Indian Ocean, 10 miles off the coast,while attempting a second approach to Hahaya Airport in Moroni.
