runway 3R at Detroit Metropolitan Wayne County Airport, in a snowstorm, the aircraft went into a steep dive and crashed into a field. The accident was caused by the FAA's failure to establish adequate aircraft certification standards for flight in icing conditions.  Contributing to the accident were the flightcrew's decision to operate in icing conditions near the lower margin of the operating airspeed envelope (with flaps retracted), and Comair's failure to establish and adequately disseminate unambiguous minimum airspeed values for flap configurations and for flight in icing conditions. In addition, Embraer's manual for the aircraft specified correctly that the deicing boots should be activated as soon as icing occured.  But the pilots were trained by Comair's manual, which specified waiting until ice was about 1/2 inch thick.", "While en rote the plane experienced engine trouble. The crew decided to divert to Sparrevohn. While attempting to land the plane encountered strong turbulence from surrounding mountains. Although full power was applied to the good engine the plane crashed into terrain. Loss of the right engine propeller control oil, which led to an overspeed of the right engine and propeller, and necessitated a shut-down of the right engine; and failure of the pilot to maintain adequate altitude/distance from terrain during visual approach for a precautionary landing at an alternate airport. Factors relating to the accident were: fluctuation of the left engine power, premature lowering of the airplane flaps, and an encounter with adverse weather conditions (including high winds, severe turbulence, and white-out conditions) during the approach.", "After being in a holding pattern for over an hour the plane hit trees and a  power line and crashed 700m short of the runway. Failure to maintain the aircraft above the Minimum Descent Altitude while the aircraft was not positioned in the final landing phase.", "The aircraft crashed shortly after taking off fromTambacoumba after losing power in the left engine.

Reports indicated that an in-flight  fire and an explosion led to the separation of the tail section prior to the crash. Superficial mechanical inspection of the aircraft which was carried out without the use of monitoring instruments and subsequent unjustified decision to extend the time between overhauls.  Inadequate monitoring to determine the state of structural elements and detect the presence of corrosion in hard-to-reach areas under the floor of the fuselage. Failure to carry out prescribed anti-corrosion measures on the aircraft structure during overhaul.", "While landing the aircraft overran the runway, hit a concrete drainage ditch, when through a fence and came to rest on a highway where it caught fire.", "On a positioning flight, while taking off the plane suffered engine failure, overran the runway and crashed into a vacant building.", "After making two approaches the pilot decided to head back to the departure airport. He flew north at an altitude beneath minimum radar coverage. The plane impacted the frozen Arctic Ocean in a right bank and at a 60 degree nose-down attitude. The pilot's intentional VFR flight into instrument meteorological conditions and his failure to maintain altitude and clearance from terrain. A contributing factor was the weather conditions.", "The cargo plane became airborne but soon lost altitude and crashed to the ground and burst into flames.", "A stray bullet from training soldiers struck the landing plane, hitting an oxygen cylinder. A fire broke out and control of the plane was lost and it crashed.", "Crashed after an engine fire.", "During the final stage of a visual approach, one of the aircraft's engines failed. The crew failed to correctly identify the problem and because of the flight regime, the propeller did not autofeather. The approach was continued, however, as the aircraft descended through about 2,000ft., power was applied at the start of a go-around. Control was lost and the aircraft crashed.", "The transport crashed into a mountain.", "The aircraft touched down hard, causing the nosegear to collapse. The pilot chose to to go-around. The aircraft climbed away but shortly after, the pilot declared an emergency and attempted to land on the runway in the opposite direction. The aircraft crashed on the runway, broke up and caught fire.The accident happened in poor weather with heavy rain associated with local thunderstorm activity.", "Crashed shortly after taking off. Fire in the cabin.", "The aircraft crashed while attemping to land. Windshear. Lack of windshear equipment at the airport.", "Shortly after taking off the cargo plane crashed into the ocean. The pilot lost control when he encountered severe weather conditions soon after taking off.", "Shot down by rebels.", "An explosion caused explosive decompression and a six-foot hole in the side of the fuselage. One passenger was sucked out and killed.  A small bomb containing only 7 ounces of explosives was placed under a passenger seat.  It is reported that the police believed the bomb was planted as part of a failed suicide attempt by one of the passengers.", "The plane crashed into the ocean 4 miles off the coast shortly after takeoff. Possible failure of the left engine during takeoff.", "The aircraft developed engine trouble (left engine caught on fire) shortly after taking off.  While attempting to make an emergency landing at Sulaiman AFB, the plane clipped roof tops of a housing project and crashed into a nearby field.", "Crashed into Mt. Yasirua in poor weather. Navigational error. No published instrument flying procedures. No GPS used for primary navigation.", "Overshot the runway in heavy rain and came to rest in brush.", "The aircraft touched down at excessive speed, far down the runway threshold, bounced twice and overran the runway.", "The aircraft crashed into Nimitz Hill, 3 miles short of Runway 06R, while making a non-precision approach in heavy rain to A.B. Won Guam International Airport. The runway glide slope system was inoperative. In addition, the Minimum Safe Altitude Warning system (MSAW) was also not working due to a software problem. The captain\u0092s failure to adequately brief and execute the non-precision approach and the first officer's and flight engineer's failure to effectively monitor and cross-check the captain\u0092s execution of the approach. Contributing to these failures were the captain's fatigue and Korean Air's  inadequate flight crew training. Contributing to the accident was the Federal Aviation Administration's (FAA) intentional inhibition of the MSAW at Guam and the agency's failure to adequately manage the system.", "Immediately after taking off the plane went into a nose-high attitude, stalled and crashed to the ground. The probable cause of the accident, which resulted from the airplane being misloaded to produce a more aft center of gravity and a correspondingly incorrect stabilizer trim setting that precipitated an extreme pitch-up at rotation, was (1) the failure of Fine Air to exercise operational control over the cargo loading process and  (2) the failure of Aeromar to load the airplane as specified by Fine Air. Contributing to the accident was the failure of the FAA to adequately monitor Fine Airs operational control responsibilities for cargo loading and the failure of the FAA to ensure that known cargo-related deficiencies were corrected at Fine Air.", "The aircraft flew into a mountain and exploded in flames after a missed approach and while executing a go-around in rain and high winds. The pilot turned right instead of left when initiating the go-around.", "Collided with a Cessna 206 (OB-1450) and crashed 3 miles from the airfield. Six killed on the Pilatus and 6 on the Cessna", "The plane was on a flight from Ho Chi Minh City to Phnom Penh when it crashed while making an approach to Pochentong International Airport in heavy rain. The plane clipped palm trees and exploded in flames after crashing into a rice paddy, one-half mile from the runway. The only survivor was a one-year-old boy. Pilot error. The captain failed to heed the warnings of the flight engineer and first officer that the plane was flying too low and failed to abort the landing.", "Struck tree tops and crashed into Lambir Hill while on approach to land at Miri.", "The aircraft was destroyed when it flew into a hillside during an approach to Uvira.", "Midair collision at 39,000 ft. The Tupolev 154 aircraft was flying at the wrong cruise altitude which caused the midair collision. Twenty-four killed aboard the Tupolev and 9 aboard the C-141. Contributing factors included weak flight-following procedures of the Luanda ATC and  poor regional ground communications.", "The aircraft crashed into mountainous terrain 15 minutes before it was due to land at Medan on a flight from Jakarta. The aircraft crashed 20 miles from the airport. Combination of ATC errors in directing the plane in the wrong direction into mountainous terrain and the crew setting and using their instruments incorrectly. Contributing to the accident was impared visibility due to smoke from forest fires in the area.", "Collided with terrain at the 9,900 foot level on the Uncompahgre Plateau. The pilot's failure to maintain sufficient airspeed for undetermined reasons while maneuvering the airplane near maximum gross weight and aft center of gravity in or near instrument meteorological conditions, which resulted in a loss of control and entry into a stall/spin.", "The aircraft crashed  near Nuevo Berlin, a town on the banks of the Uruguay River, after changing its route to avoid heavy rain and hail. A crater 25 feet deep crater was created where the plane crashed into the earth.  Icing of the pitot tubes. The pitot tubes froze after the aircraft passed through 49,000 ft. giving false speed readings leading to loss of control of the aircraft.", "Crashed in poor weather after a go-around.", "The aircraft had just finished performing 3 touch-and-go landings at Monterey Peninsula Airport. Shortly after taking off a fourth time, witnesses heard the engine make popping noises, bank to the right, pitch up, and go into a steep dive from about a  500 foot altitude and crash into the sea about 150 yards offshore. Singer John Denver, 53, who was piloting the plane, was killed. Denver, an experienced pilot with over 2,800 flying hours, had only a little over an hour in the experimental plane. The accident was caused by the inadvertent application of right rudder by the pilot as he attempted to manipulate the fuel selector handle. The unmarked fuel selector handle in this aircraft was located in a hard to reach area behind the pilot's left shoulder, instead of between his legs. This required removing his harness and reaching behind. While turning around, he inadvertently pressed down on the plane's right rudder pedal causing the aircraft to roll and go into a dive.  Contributing factors were, Denver took off with too little fuel in one tank which led to the necessity of switching to his backup tank. Also it was difficult to determine how much fuel was in the tanks due to the unmarked fuel quantity sight gauge.", "Crashed during a landing attempt.", "A few minutes after takeoff a distress call was received from the aircraft after which it ditched into the sea 200 yards offshore. The pilot's disregard for lateral fuel loading limits, his improper removal of frost prior to takeoff, and the resulting inadvertent stall/spin. Factors involved in this accident were the improper asymmetrical fuel loading which reduced lateral aircraft control, the self-induced pressure to takeoff on time by the pilot, and inadequate surveillance of the company operations by company management.", "The military aircraft, bound for Vladivostok, crashed into a residential neighborhood twenty seconds after taking off. All four engines failed after the computer system began shutting them down shortly after takeoff.  Design flaw which led to uncoordinated operation of the high-pressure compressors.", "Crashed during the second approach right of the approach path. While the aircraft was being manoeuvred at a very low level in marginal weather, it descended after an abrupt turn and flew, in controlled flight, into the terrain. Crew procedural error. The aircraft was 1,000 pounds heavier than the maximum allowable weight.  The GPS installed in aircraft was not approved as a primary navigational aid.", "During take off, shortly after the landing gear was retracted, one of the aircraft's engines lost power and the propeller autofeathered. The aircraft rolled to the right, struck trees and crashed inverted.", "The aircraft crashed and burned while making an attempt to land. A number of errors by the crew resulted in the acccident. Not maintaining the height indicated during the last contact with the ATC. Not following instructions from the ATC. Crew fatigue and turbulence in the area contributed to the accident.", "The aircraft crashed into Mt. Olympus while approaching Salonica, during a second attempt to land. The plane was holding at 3,300 feet due to heavy traffic. Tower tapes indicate that after the missed approach, the crew reported they were heading north when they actually were heading west. An investigation revealed the crew had poor training, flew too low, didn't know how to use the radar equipment and failed to declare an emergency after they missed the landing strip. A second crash occurred when a C-130 transport plane on its way to pick up troops to assist in the search, crashed into Pastra Mountain.", "The plane disappeared off radar screens and shortly after, crashed into the Musi River. The plane, almost brand-new, cruising in good weather and with an experienced crew, suddenly left normal flight from 35,000 feet and crashed at a high rate of speed into the Sumatran jungle. The right wing and parts of the rudder separated from the aircraft before it crashed. The Indonesian National Transportation Committee found that there was insufficient evidence to find a cause for the accident. The U.S. National Transportation Safety Board strongly disagreed and stated the jet's cockpit voice recorder was intentionally disconnected and its flight controls placed in a nose-down position most likely by the captain. While the U.S. NTSB stopped short of using the term suicide, its dissenting report made it clear it believed the crash was the result of actions by the captain. In July 2004 a California jury found the manufacturer of the PCU valve that controls rudder responsible for the accident after the valve was located and showed defects which may have led to a rudder hardover.", "Crashed in the Pastra mountains while searching for the wreckage of an Aerosweet Yak-42 that was missing.", "Went missing while en route. May have been shot down.", "Two hours into the flight, at FL 310, the plane received reports of severe clear air turbulence in the area and the seat belt sign was turned on. Moments later, the aircraft suddenly dropped around one hundred feet seriously injuring many passengers and causing damage to the aircraft. The plane landed safely back at Tokyo, but  one passenger died of her injuries.", "Crashed into dense jungle, 4 miles short of its destination in heavy fog."]}
