The failure of the captain in charge of the flight to exercise the proper degree of fare by not checking his altimeters to determine whether both were correctly set and properly functioning before commencing his landing approach.

There was no fire in the plane prior to impact. No evidence of sabotage was discovered. There was no power plant failure prior to the accident, and the engines were functioning normally at the time the plane struck the ground. Nothing was found to indicate that there had been any structural failure or failure of the control system of the plane. As a result of the complete destruction of some portions of the plane, it was impossible to eliminate the possibility that such failure occurred.
