The minimal braking effectiveness on the ice-covered runway. The crew landed without sufficient information as to runway conditions. Lack of FAA regulations.

All engines failed and the windshield lost transparency because of pitting. The first engine was restarted at 12,000 feet, followed by the other three and the plane landed safely at Jakarta. The aircraft was named \"City of Edinburgh.\"", "From an altitude of 30,000 ft., a malfunction occurred causing the aircraft to crash 125 miles from its destination. In-flight failure and jamming of stabilizer screw-jack mechanism due to wear.", "?", "The aircraft crashed and burned in field shortly after takeoff. Failure of the aircraft's power plant fire warning system due to design deficiencies which resulted in false fire indications in both engines.", "The aircraft crashed during a thunderstorm, 29 seconds after taking off from New Orleans International Airport. The plane reached an altitude of 95 to 150 feet and then began to descend and crashed into trees and houses bursting into flames. Microbust induced windshear. Limited capability of current ground-based low-level windshear detection technology. The aircraft was named \"Clipper Defiance.\"", "Takeoff was aborted at V1 when the crew heard unusual sounds from the No.1 engine. The aircraft overran the runway and came to rest against a wall and some vehicles. Misjudged speed and distance and delayed action in aborting the takeoff.", "During the filming of \"Twilight Zone, The Movie\", a helicopter crashed, killing actor Vic Morrow, 53, and two child actors. The helicopter was hovering low over a make believe Vietnamese village when an explosive charge from the special effects hit the tail rotor of the helicopter sending it crashing to the ground. One child, Rene Chen, 6, was crushed to death with the right skid. Vic Morrow and the other child, Myca Dinh Le, 7, were decapitated. Criminal charges against the production company were eventually dismissed in a much publicized trial. The civil trial ended in awards of 2 million dollars to the families of each of the children and $700,000  to the estate of Vic Morrow.", "A sixteen-year-old boy was killed when a bomb detonated under a seat cushion.

Eleven killed on the LET and none on the Tupolev.", "Flew into a mountain in the Andes after the pilot became disoriented in a low ceiling.", "The plane ran out of fuel on the third approach in poor weather.", "Crashed helicopter experiencing catastrophic mechanical failure and separation of one of the rotors. The aircraft was carrying French and German sky divers as part of Mannheim's 375 birthday celebration. Bearing failure in the forward transmission pack.", "The aircraft crashed during takeoff after intense vibration caused by a blown retreaded tire. The crew aborted the takeoff above VR and overran the runway. They also  failed to apply reverse thrust symmetrically.", "The aircraft swerved to the right after landing, sideswiped a water tower, crashed into a building and continued into a revine where it exploded and burned. Failure of the control mechanism on the No.1 engine reverser.", "The helicopter crashed into the sea.", "Flew into a mountain while descending for a landing.", "Crashed into a mountain. Flying under VFR in IFR conditions, navigation error and lack of adequate training.", "The cargo plane flew into a hill while descending to land. The pilot may have had a physical imparement.", "While on approach, the aircraft suddenly banked to the left and went into a steep descent and crashed.  Inadequate flight procedures by the pilot in command after experiencing a loss of power in the left engine.  Inadequate flight planning by the pilot-in-command in coordinating the adoption of measures and applying procedures to successfully remedy a stall condition caused by total loss of power in the left engine when the aircraft was flying at low altitude on final approach to land.", "The helicopter was shot down by Sandinistan rebels.", "Inadequate and untimely actions of the crew in retracting  the flaps after takeoff, which resulted in severe loss of height and collision with obstacles. Overloaded,", "A passenger's cigarette caused a fire in the cabin which led to an oxygen tank exploding."]}
