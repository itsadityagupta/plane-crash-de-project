The plane was blown against the building by a strong gust of wind.", "The aircraft pitched up, rolled to the left, went into a steep spiral dive and crashed into the sea. Detonation of an explosive device in the aft cargo hold. A Palestinian organization claimed responsibility. The blast probably buckled the cabin floor damaging the elevator and rudder controls.", "The aircraft flew too low and struck trees 3.3 miles short of the runway during an approach in fog. Flightcrew's lack of altitude awareness at critical points during the approach due to poor cockpit discipline in that the crew did not follow prescribed procedures. The crewmembers were preoccupied with conversations having nothing to do with the operating the aircraft while conducting an instrument approach. The aircraft was 50 knots too fast and 500 feet below the final approach fix.", "Hijacked. Detonation of two hand grenades in the passenger compartment after the pilot refused to fly to Hanoi, North Vietnam. The aircraft attempted to land, executed a missed approach and dove into the ground from a height of 1,000 feet.", "One hour after takeoff, cruising at FL85, the No.1 engine had to be shut down due to severe vibrations and backfiring.

The crew's decision to descend before aircraft reached the approach segment. The crew ignored high terrain marked on the en route chart and continued their descent. Lack of clarity in ATC procedures. The issuance of the approach clearance when the flight was 44 miles from the airport on an unpublished route without clearly defined minimum altitudes. Inadequate depiction of altitude restrictions on the profile view of the approach chart for the VOR/DME approach to Runway 12 at Dulles International Airport.", "The aircraft stalled in a climb from which recovery was not effected. The loss of control of the aircraft because the flight crew failed to recognize and correct the aircraft's high-angle-of-attack, low-speed stall and its descending spiral. The stall was precipitated by the flight crew's improper reaction to erroneous airspeed and Mach indications which had resulted from a blockage of the pitot heads by atmospheric icing. Contrary to standard operational procedures, the flight crew had not activated the pitot head heaters.", "The An-2 crashed after colliding with Antonov 12 over Irkutsk airport.
