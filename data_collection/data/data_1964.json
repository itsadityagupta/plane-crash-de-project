Improper IFR procedures by the crew.", "The crew was completing a maritime patrol flight out from Rota NAS when the airplane crashed in unknown circumstances into the Atlantic Ocean some 40 km off the NAS. All 10 occupants were killed.", "While attempting to land at Clark Air Force Base, the aircraft contacted the perimeter fence, 3,500 ft. from the threshold of the runway, causing the plane to clip the tower and crash 300 ft. left of the runway center line. The aircraft also struck a taxi killing the driver. Wrong approach configuration on part of the flying crew who decided to continue the approach despite he was instructed by ATC to abandon the approach and to go around", "Struck a hill while taking off. The pilot continued to fly VFR into unfavourable weather over the jagged shoreline with practically zero visibility due to heavy rain. At the time of the accident, the visibility was below minima.", "The plane was being used for training. Witnesses reported the plane exploded in the air  and broke in three parts before reaching the ground. The body of one of the crew was seen being thrown out of the cabin.", "Crashed into the Red Sea.", "The plane crashed on takeoff into a rice paddy at San Chiao Village north northeast of the airport. The pilot discovered the left engine was overspeeding and made an abrupt left turn to land at Kung-Kuan Military Air Base. During the turn he lost control and crashed into mountains. Probable cause: About 5 miles west of the accident site was Kung-Kuan Military Air Base. Six miles south-southwest was Shui-Nan Airport from where the aircraft took off. On the right side of the flight pattern was a chain of mountains. It was concluded that, when the pilot found that the left engine was overspeeding, he made an abrupt left turn to land at Kung-Kuan Military Air Base or return to Shui-Nan Airport. During the turn he lost control of the aircraft, which crashed to the ground.", "Both engines failed and the plane ditched 1 mile offshore and sank.", "While climbing to cruise altitude the plane hit turbulence, downdrafts and updrafts. One passenger's seat belt  failed, killing the passenger.", "The plane crashed 2 miles northeast of Parrottsville after experiencing an uncontrollable fire of unknown origin which started below the passenger floor and eventually involved the passenger cabin. One passenger died after free-falling out of the No. 4 emergency escape window of the plane in an attempt to escape the onboard fire. The ignition source was never determined, but it is thought the plane's battery or something in a passenger's luggage caused the fire.  Testing revealed lethal amounts of CO2 could be discharged into the cockpit instead of the lower baggage compartment. The plane was seen flying erratically and the fire eventually burned through the controls.  It is likely the crew was unconscious by then.", "The aircraft departed Frankfurt on a training mission. After completing several maneuvers, the crew was cleared to descend to 3,600 feet when control was lost. The airplane rolled inverted and crashed in an explosion in a field located in Ansbach.", "Landed 17 feet short of the runway threshold, tore off the landing gear, slid and caught fire. Pilot misjudged altitude and distance and undershot during landing.", "The aircraft crashed during an intense rainstorm into dense woods 6.5 miles south of the Nashville airport,  while on a return trip from Batesville Arkansas. It took searchers 2 days to find the wreckage. Country western singer Jim Reeves, 40, and his manager, Dean Manuel were killed. Reeves was piloting the plane and was 2 minutes from touchdown when he apparently lost visual reference with the ground and experienced spatial disorientation. Pilot error. VFR flight into adverse weather conditions.", "Struck Huayna Hill in poor weather. The flight was conducted in IMC conditions at an altitude unsafe for operations of that nature through the Huayna Pass.", "After insisting on and getting a direct approach without completing a standard traffic pattern, the airliner crashed into a wooded hillside. The controller lacked the radar with which to monitor the flight. Blame was placed on both the crew of the airliner and the ATC. Lack of radar facilities. Premature descent. Inexperience with the area and poor flight planning.", "Struck a tree and crashed during a nighttime landing attempt.", "Crashed into Mt. Nova. Deviated off course for unknown reasons.", "The cargo plane touched down, bounced twice, climbed and crashed. Improperly loaded cargo.", "The cargo plane left the runway and crashed while landing.", "About an hour and a half after departing Palma de Mallorca the airliner crashed into Mt. Alcazaba, 20 miles SSE of Granada. Deviated off course. Cause unknown.", "En route, the airplane encountered strong downdrafts and severe turbulences, causing the fuselage to fail.", "Instructed to land at Belgrade from the west, the aircraft was too low and off course when it hit Avala Hill, 600 ft. below the peak, exploding in flames.", "The aircraft was part of a parachute dropping demonstration at an air show at El Centro Air base. The A-3D bomber, while flying low, faltered, lost altitude, hiit a power pole, broke apart and crashed in flames. Part of the aircraft struck the base administration building killing 6 people inside.", "Crashed while en route after pilot continued VFR flight into adverse weather conditions.", "The aircraft crashed  into rising terrain 9.7 miles south southwest of Mc Carran Field in a snowstorm during an approach to the airport. Captain's misinterpretation of approach charts leading to premature descent below obstructing terrain. After years of legal court battles, a U.S. District Court Judge concluded that the landing charts provided by Jeppesen were the main cause of the accident.", "Crashed into the ocean while on maneuvers.", "Descended prematurely struck the ground 2 km short of  the runway. Crew mistook lights perpendicular to the runway for runway lights and descended prematurely.", "The captain decided to abort the takeoff after the No. 4 engine pressure ratio read zero thrust and the amber warning light indicating thrust reversal of No. 2 engine came on. The speed was below V1. The aircraft continued to travel past the runway limit and the No. 4 engine struck a pavement roller. The aircraft burst into flames. Malfunction of the No. 2 engine reverse thruster. The malfunction allowed in the development of forward thrust by No. 2 engine even though all four levers were in the reverse position.", "While taking off, the aircraft struck an empty fuel drum on the runway which tore away the right stabilizer. The plane lifted off the ground but lost control and crashed.", "The plane crashed in the Andes Mountains after an explosion blew off the tail of the aircraft. Detonation of a bomb in the tail section of the passenger cabin. A suicide-for-insurance plot was suspected.", "Hit a mountain shortly after taking off exploding in flames.", "After losing the No. 1 engine the pilot decided to return to Kalibo but could not land do to poor weather. He attempted to divert to Bacolod but could not climb to avoid terrain and crashed into a fish pond while attempting to ditch in the sea.  Failure to maintain safe single engine speed and altitude following failure of the left engine. The precipitation and poor visibility prevailing at the time of the accident over Kalibo and its vicinity and the failure on the part of the maintenance personnel to take action to correct discrepancies logged in the aircraft log-book, individually or collectively contributed to the cause of the accident.", "Cashed on takeoff.", "The cargo plane flew off course and struck a mountain in the San Bruno range. The pilot, for undetermined reasons, deviated from departure course into an area of rising terrain where downdraft activity and turbulence affected the climb capability of the aircraft sufficiently to prevent terrain clearance.", "The cargo plane crashed on slope of the Turrialba Volcano while en route.", "The cargo plane veered off course and struck trees while attempting to land.  Loss of control during night instrument approach in adverse weather for undetermined reasons."]}
