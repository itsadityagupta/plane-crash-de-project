The VOR/DME had been sabotaged by terrorists and not in service.", "The cargo plane impacted a hill while on visual approach to El Yopal.", "On final approach at low speed the left wing dropped and touched the ground during a stall or deliberate low left turn. The plane cartwheeled and broke up.", "The cargo aboard shifted after takeoff, the plane nosed up, stalled and crashed.", "The crew reported they were diverting due to thunderstorms. Soon after the aircraft crashed after encountering severe turbulence.", "The plane overran the runway while attempting to land in rain and reduced visibility and crashed onto a beach.", "Shot down by Abkhazi forces.", "The helicopter crashed while attempting to land in a confined area of the infield of the Talladega Super Speedway. The pilot of the helicopter, NASCAR race car driver Davey Allison, 30, killed. The pilot's poor in-flight decision to land downwind in a confined area that was surrounded by high obstructions, and his failure to properly compensate for the tailwind condition.", "The aircraft crashed into a lake after it was unable to get airborne while attempting to takeoff. Mechanical failure. Flaps selected but did not extend.", "The aircraft hit Mt. Ungeo at 800 ft. while on approach after two missed landing attempts in high winds and heavy rain. Captain's decision to land in weather that had fallen below minima.", "The aircraft ran low of fuel while en route and crashed during the subsequent attempted forced landing on open ground in the jungle. The aircraft strayed off course after encountering poor weather conditions.", "The aircraft flew into a hillside during a visual approach to Bharatpur. The accident happened in daylight and good weather, however,  the mountains were shrouded in clouds.", "The cargo plane crashed 1/4 of a mile short of the runway, while on approach. the captain had decided, for no particular reason, to  land from the west, requiring a sharp turn just before the runway to stay within the US-controlled military base. He then became fixated on sighting the strobe light marking the border, not having\n   been informed that it was not working. Primary cause was impaired judgment, decision-making, and flying abilities of the captain and flight crew due to the effects of fatigue.", "A sudden pitch-up during approach led the crew to go-around.  The pitch-up continued until the plane stalled and crashed.  Improperly loaded baggage shifted the center of gravity beyond the acceptable limit.", "While taking off, the aircraft, overloaded by 3 times the number of people the plane was designed for, never got airborne, overran the runway and crashed into the Pyanj river. The crew was coerced into taking off by armed men who commandeered the plane.", "The aircraft skidded off  the end of the runway while landing. The crew was made aware of windshear at approach end of runway but not of poor water drainage on the runway nor a change in wind direction. A very light touch of the runway surface with the landing gear and lack of compression of the left landing gear leg to the extent understood by the aircraft computer as the actual landing, resulted in delayed deployment of spoilers and thrust reversers. The delay was about 9 seconds. Thus, the braking commenced with delay and in a condition of heavy rain and strong tailwind the aircraft did not stop on the runway. The aircraft was named \"Kulbach.\"", "Crashed into the sea. Shot down with a missile by Abkhazi separatist rebels.", "The aircraft was hit by a missile then crash landed on the runway. Terrorist act  by Abkhazian rebels.", "?", "The plane was on a senic flight of the Mt. Cook area and impacted Franz Josef Glacier at 4,500 ft. The aircraft became trapped in a narrow valley and as the pilot attempted to turn around within the valley the aircraft stalled while it was in a steep bank.", "While landing during a rainstorm, the aircraft went off the end of the runway, into a swamp, collapsing the landing gear and breaking the fuselage into three sections.", "The aircraft descended below minima during a localizer approach, without a glideslope, struck the top of trees and crashed into a swamp in heavy rain showers and strong winds.", "The aircraft took off and made a low right turn, struck trees and crashed. The crew most likely lost situational awareness and as a result did not detect the increasing deviation from their intended flight path. Contributing factor was the loss of AC power to some of the flight instruments the reason for which could not be determined.", "The plane crashed short of the runway while landing in dense fog, hitting power lines and a wall. The autopilot disconnected during approach and re-engaged with the vertical speed mode at 800ft/min.", "Crashed while in a holding pattern and after running out of fuel. The crew did not follow a standard holding pattern.", "The airliner crashed and exploded after an aborted landing at Ohrid Airport. The aircraft was diverted to Ohrid because of bad weather. Violation of airport traffic pattern. The flight had earlier carried out a missed approach but the crew had reportedly failed to follow the normal procedure and as a result lost situational awareness. The VOR beacon not working. Misunderstanding because air traffic controller spoke Macedonian while the crew used Russian and English in their transmissions.", "While on approach, the aircraft collided with trees and terrain 3 miles from the runway threshold in fog and freezing drizzle. Delay by the captain to start the descent which led to a breakdown in crew coordination and the loss of altitude awareness by the flightcrew during an unstabilized approach in night instrument meteorological conditions.", "Four minutes after taking off the pilot reported he was having engine problems and was returning. The aircraft subsequently crashed onto a frozen lake, 7.7nm from the airfield in darkness.", "Midair collision. The Twin Otter, which was descending inbound to Dakar, collided with a Gambia Airways aircraft which had just taken off. The Twin Otter crashed into the sea. Failure to maintain assigned altitude. Three killed aboard the Twin Otter. The YS-11 was able to land safely.", "Crashed on approach to Phongsavanh Airport after striking trees in heavy fog.", "Flew into the side of Mt. Manase at 2,000 ft., 21nm from the airport  during a VOR approach to Naga. The pilot descended too low in heavy rain and zero visibility.", "The aircraft stalled and crashed in fog when the tail struck the runway as the pilot attempted a go-around as it landed at Gyumri."]}
