The captain choose a direct VOR/DME approach instead of the safer ILS. The copilot lacked the ability to land the tricky approach. The pilot who was not flying the plane, did not observe the copilot was flying a too steep of an approach. The NTSB isssued a report that stated that the captain was a heavy user of cocaine and traces were found in his blood and urine.", "Crashed in mountains.", "The plane stalled and crashed after a loss of engine power on takeoff. The engine throttles were reduced at  a critical stage of the takeoff for undetermined reasons, probably by the crew.", "Flew into a mountain.", "The plane was struck by lightning and suffered a complete electrical failure after which the right wing broke off during an uncontrollable descent.", "The plane crashed into a reservoir shortly after taking off in low visibility and ceiling. The failure of the flight crew to maintain a proper flight path because of the first officer's inappropriate instrument scan, the captain's inadequate monitoring of the flight, and the flight  and the flight crew's response to a perceived fault in the airplane's stall avoidance system.", "The aircraft made a hard landing beside the runway, broke up and caught fire. Crew error. Visual contact with the runway was lost as the aircraft descended through the decision height.", "Crashed into mountain 20 kms E of Kyrenia Turkey while on approach. Crew error.

Pilot error.", "The aircraft struck a mountain at 6,200 feet after taking off in mist and haze. The crew took off under VFR conditions during adverse weather conditions. Inappropriate presence of a non-crew pilot in the cockpit and his great talkativeness distracting part of the crew which resulted in carelessness and disorientation in monitoring the heading and altitude necessary to maneuver the plane.

Fflight attendant C.B. Lansing was sucked out of the opening in the fuselage and her body never recovered. The plane named Queen Lili'uokalani, made a safe emergency landing at Kahuiui Airport on Maui. Failure of Aloha Airline's maintenance program to detect the presence of disbonding and fatigue damage which led to failure of the lap joint at S-10L and the separation of the fuselage upper lobe. Contributing factors were the failure of Aloha Airline's management to properly supervise its maintenance crew as well as the failure of the FAA to properly evaluate the Aloha Airlines maintenance program and to assess the airline's inspection and quality control deficiencies. In addition the maintenance program underestimated the need for inspections with the large number of pressurizations/depressurizations and humid salt air climate the plane was subjected to.", "Crashed into a hillside during approach in foggy weather. The crew started the approach to 4NM too early. Navigation error. Pilot error.", "The aircraft encountered heavy rain and hail which resulted in flame-out of both engines. Attempts to restart engines were unsuccessful. The aircraft landed safely in a grassy field between a drainage ditch and levee with no power. Water ingestion due to heavy rain from a level 4 thunderstorm caused failure of both engines. A contributing cause of the incident was the inadequate design of the engines and the FAA water ingestion certification standards which did not reflect the waterfall rates that can be expected in moderate or higher intensity thunderstorms.", "The cargo plane crashed.", "While landing the cargo plane pitched up for a go-around causing cargo to shift and the plane to lose control and crash.", "The airliner crashed 3 miles short of the runway in poor visibility. Crew's overconfidence and  incorrect in-flight planning.", "?", "The plane was scheduled to perform a series of fly-bys at an air show. The plane was to descend to 100 ft. altitude with landing gear and flaps extended. The automatic go-around protection (Alpha Floor Function) was inhibited for the maneuver. During the maneuver, the plane descended thru 100 ft. to an altitude of 30 feet and hit trees at the end of the runway. The aircraft was totally destroyed by the successive impacts and violent fire which followed. The pilot allowed the aircraft to descend through 100 ft. at slow speed and maximum angle of attack and was late in applying go-around power. Unfamiliarity of the crew with the landing field and lack of planning for the flyby.", "The civilian Iranian airliner was shot down by the U.S. Navy vessel U.S.S. Vincennes with surface-to-air missiles. The Vincennes was protecting other civilian ships in the area from Iranian gunboats. The Vincennes responded to hostile action taking place against a ship by Iranian gun boats. However, orders to the captain were to send a helicopter to investigate but maintain position. In fact, the ship headed towards the hostilities and penetrated 2nm inside Iranian territorial waters and after the helicopter was fired upon, engaged the enemy boats. The ill-fated airliner was delayed in leaving Bandar Abbas because of a problem with the passport of a passenger. Soon after taking off the target appeared on the radar of the Vincennes. Because the plane was late and confusion of time zones, the crew was not expecting an airliner in the area. When the target was first identified, it squawked both 2 (military) and 3 (civilian). The reason for this was the radar tracker ball was left in the vicinity of the Bandar Abbas airport and the radar was picking up both the airliner and a military F-14 jet fighter at the same time. Playing it safe, the plane was misidentified as a F-14 Iranian fighter. The aircraft did not respond to 10 radio challenges from the Vincennes. However, 7 were on military frequencies which the airliner could not pick up. Three were on the civil emergency frequency addressed to the so called military F-14. When the plane was nearing 10 miles from the ship, it was reported to the captain that the aircraft was descending. At that time the surface-to-air missiles were fired destroying the aircraft. At the inquiry computer data showed that the plane was never descending and actually was ascending at a steady rate. Incredibly, a military investigation concluded that although the U.S. government regretted the loss of human life, the captain and crew were not at fault and acted properly in shooting down the airliner.", "Shortly after taking off the crew of the cargo plane experienced failure of the No. 4 engine and a fire.
