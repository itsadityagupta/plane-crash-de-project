It is not possible to determine why the pilots did not see each other, but the evidence suggests that it resulted from any one or a combination of the following factors: 1) Intervening clouds reducing time for visual separation 2) Visual limitations due to cockpit visibility 3) Preoccupation with normal cockpit duties.

The decision of the pilot to descend en route, without justifiable reason, below the minimum altitude prescribed for a night flight and in weather conditions which made it his duty to follow IFR procedure.", "Struck Mt Pindaya near Thazi .", "The aircraft crashed after a missed approach. The crew executing full retraction of flaps without increasing power or changing attitude resulting in loss of lift after the missed approach.", "The aircraft had to return to Amman for an emergency landing. The landing took place with the gear retracted. The plane bounced, went up a hill and down the other side and burst into flames.", "Midair collision. Both planes landed safely. Failure of both aircraft to observe and avoid the other aircraft.", "Crashed while en route. The action of the pilot in flying into conditions of darkness and adverse weather in which he could not maintain adequate control of the aircraft.", "The plane disappeared over the Atlantic while on a flight from Royal Air Force Base in England to McGuire Air Force Base in New Jersey. Cause unknown.", "The aircraft ditched into the Pacific Ocean while on a flight from San Francisco to Honolulu after losing the No. 1 and then the No. 4 engine. The aircraft circled around the U.S. Coast Guard cutter \"Pontchartrain\", at Ocean Station November until daybreak after which it made a successful ditching with no casualties. Probable Cause: An initial mechanical failure which precluded feathering the No.1 propeller and a subsequent mechanical failure which resulted in a complete loss of power from the No.4 engine, the effects of which necessitated a ditching. The aircraft was named \"Clipper Sovereign of the Sky.\"", "The cargo plane crashed after an attempted go-around. On final, as the pilot-in-command was unable to locate the runway, he decided to make a new go around when the aircraft struck trees and crashed in flames few km short of runway.", "Shot down by the Israeli Air Force.", "While attempting to land the aircraft descended below the ILS glideslope and hit a tree. Using the lights of the airport the captain misjudged the height he was flying.", "The aircraft took off, experienced icing, lost altitude and crashed into Hommelfjell Mountain. Unusually heavy icing which the aircraft encountered. Severe downdraft immediately prior to the crash may have been a contributing factor.", "An unsuccessful belly landing was attempted on flat terrain following a fire in the fuel system.", "Hit El Rucio Mountain at 6,200 ft. which was obscured by clouds. Lack of cockpit discipline. Flight on instruments at an excessively low altitude for the route.", "Lost altitude on takeoff and crashed into a house. Failed to climb for reasons unknown. The aircraft's slight loss of altitude soon after take off was the main cause of the accident. There is no explanation for this loss of altitude. Orchestra and opera conductor Guido Cantelli, 36, among those killed.", "Crashed into a field shortly after taking off about 12 km north of the airport.", "Struck Silla de Caracas Mountain at 6,700 feet while approaching to land at Maiquetia. Navigation error. The pilot did not follow prescribed approach procedures. St. Louis Cardinal outfielder, Charlie Peete, 27, killed.", "The starboard engine failed shortly after takoff and  the plane crash into Quetame Hill, 25km northwest of Santa Cecilia  Airport. Complete failure of the starboard engine due to the breakdown of the lubricating system. Recklessness of the pilot in taking off from a closed airport while aware of the poor weather conditions. The aircraft was also overloaded.", "The aircraft departed Vancouver en route to Calgary. Some 50 minutes later the pilot reported a fire in the No. 2 engine and was turning back. While flying under the power of 3 engines, the aircraft encountered severe icing, turbulence or other difficulty which led to the loss of control by the crew. It could not be determined why the aircraft was 12 miles south of the assigned airway. The plane crashed high into Mount Slesse. The bodies and wreckage were not found until 05/12/1957 and the wreckage still remains at the site which is now a memorial.", "Crashed in a steep angle of attack.", "The co-pilot acting as pilot-in-command and under the instruction of the captain began a descent to land until the aircraft hit the ground, left wing first. Both wings detached and the fuselage slid 1,200 feet.", "The aircraft strayed off the assigned airway and hit a mountain. The pilot did not follow the airways assigned in the flight plan. He did not check his direction and position along the new route. Pilot error.", "Crashed and burned while attempting to land in heavy fog at night."]}
