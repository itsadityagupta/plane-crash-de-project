Possible failure of radar equipment.", "The No. 3 engine failed during the takeoff roll as the plane left Agana Naval Air Station. The aircraft began to rise but struck terrain and exploded in flames. The loss of climb capability after the crew retracted the flaps at too low an altitude to clear the rising terrain. The flaps were retracted after the No. 3 propeller feathered as the aircraft lifted off the runway. A driver in an automobile struck by the aircraft was killed.", "Stalled and crashed into the sea during the approach two miles from the airport.", "The plane was hijacked ,in Athens, by Palestinian terrorists and flown to Entebbe Uganda. Seven passengers were killed during a commando raid by Israeli armed forces to free the hostages.", "Caught fire and exploded.", "The No. 3 engine failed during the approach and the No. 4 engine was feathered by mistake. The No. 4 engine was restarted but  the aircraft lost control and crashed into Zlat\u00e9 piesky lake after a decision to go-around was made.", "Instead of turning on course the cargo plane continued straight and hit a mountain.", "Crashed 15 minutes after taking off. An engine caught fire.", "Crashed while en route. Struck the slope of Mt Chimborazo. Controlled filght into terrain.", "A hijacker set off two grenades in the cabin and was killed.", "The aircraft suffered structural failure after flying into a severe thunderstorm. The starboard wing, horizontal stabilizer and vertical tail fin separated from the aircraft.", "Crashed while climbing to cruise altitude. Failed to maintain adequate rotor speed.", "Crashed into a hill one mile short of the runway in heavy rain and wind while attempting to land at Lajes Air Base. Members of the Venezuelan choir Orfeon Universitario killed. The aircraft was not properly aligned with the runway as it made its approach. Weather conditions associated with hurricane Emmy was the primary factor in the accident.", "Midair collision at FL187.  ATC error. Forty-six deaths on the Antonov, 18 on the Yak. Violation of separation rules. Contributing causes were insufficient visual alertness on the part of both crews and a lack of situation analysis based on air/ground radio communications.", "Midair collision. Both planes flew towards the same VOR at the same altitude at the same time. ATC error, negligence in operations. Improper look-out duties on both aircraft. One hundred thirteen deaths on the DC-9 and 63 on the Trident. The entire shift of controllers were arrested. One was found guilty of criminal negligence and sentenced to seven years in jail but release after 3 1/2 years. The controller was made a scapegoat. The real cause was a run down air traffic control system.", "The aircraft struck Mt. Karatepa during an approach to land. The crew attempted to land at the wrong airport, landing at Isparta instead of Antalya.", "Crash-landed in rugged terrain broke up and landed in a swamp. Possilbe cabin pressure problem causing the plane to disintegrate in the air.", "The cargo plane struck Mt. Kenya while descending to land. Descended prematurely.", "Ten minutes after taking off from Barbados the aircraft reported an explosion aboard. The plane was seen below the overcast trailing smoke. The aircraft crashed into the Caribbean sea. Detonation of an explosive device in the aft of the cabin which initiated an uncontrollable fire which led to the incapacitation of the crew.", "The cargo plane failed to climb and crashed into trees, poles and houses at the end of the runway and came to rest in a soccer field 560 meters beyond the runway. The failure of the crew to select enough thrust to achieve the necessary acceleration. Crew fatigue.", "The aircraft crash landed in flames during an emergency landing. The right engine failed during takeoff. A fatigue crack in compressor led to engine destruction, severing of fuel lines and fire. The fire spread because the crew did not shut off the fuel supply.", "The airplane was seen to initiate a turn to the left when it stalled and crashed in a field.", "After overshooting the runway, a go-around was initiated but abrupt application of power made an engine autofeather after which the plane crashed.", "The cargo plane went missing between Curacao - Port-au-Prince.", "The airliner crashed into mountainous terrain after being diverted to Kozani due to poor weather at Larissa. Controlled flight into terrain. Premature descent.", "After taking off an artificial horizon failure caused the crew to become disoriented and exceed bank angle limits and crash.", "The plane crashed short of the runway in rain. Windshear. The aircraft's rate of descent and descent flight path angle increased as a result of windshear encountered during visual approach below minimum descent altitude. The flight crew did not recognize these flightpath deviations because they were relying on visual references which were degraded by non-homogeneous fog and on kinesthetic cues which were adversely affected by the aircraft's forward center of gravity resulting from the improperly loaded aircraft.", "The cargo plane crashed into trees on takeoff. Deviation in preparation for the flight by the crew and pilot error in the technique used during the takeoff.", "In heavy fog  the crew continued their descend below decision height, although they had not obtained visual contact with the runway. The fact that visibility had decreased below minima (700 m) was not reported to the crew.", "The survey fllight deviated from the approach pattern and crashed into Mount Ostraya.", "The aircraft crashed into an industrial area during a landing attempt. Lack of altitude awareness and disorientation leading to an uncontrolled descent. Crew did not make use of navigational aids.", "Struck the slope of Mt Pintado located 25 km north of the airport shortly after taking off from Trujillo."]}
