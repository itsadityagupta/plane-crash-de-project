Controllled flight into terrain.", "Shortly after takeoff in poor visibility and heavy snow, with autothrottles engaged, climb thrust was selected. The right engine throttle jammed and remained at takeoff thrust, while the left engine throttle slowly reduced to idle. The increasing thrust asymmetry resulted in an increasing left bank angle, which eventually reached about 170 degrees. The airplane lost altitude and impacted the ground. Lack of crew response to an extreme nose-down attitude. The investigation concluded that the captain was incapacitated. Just before impact the first officer expressed his concern about the situation of either the captain's incapacitation or the aircraft's attitude and attempted a recovery.", "The aircraft experienced a micoburst while attempting to land at Lagos landing hard on the nosegear. Full power was applied for a go-around but the aircraft veered off the runway and collided with another aircraft.", "While returning from Anuradhapura and descending through 3,000 ft the aircraft was shot down with a SAM missile by Tamil separatists.", "The SA-227 collided with the Piper PA-31-350 that was taking off while approaching Sioux Lookout. Neither flight crew saw the other aircraft in time to avoid the collision. The Piper crashed into a  wooded area and the Swearing into Lake Seul. Contributing to the occurrence were the inherent limitations of the see-and-avoid concept which preclude the effective separation of aircraft with high closure rates, the fact that neither crew was directly alerted to the presence of the other aircraft by the Flight Service specialist or by onboard electronic equipment and an apparent lack of pilot understanding of how to optimize avoidance maneuvering.", "Crashed into Cerro Sincholagua mountain at 16,000 ft.  during an approach to Quito. Pilot fatigue may have been a factor.", "Crashed into a mountain during approach in poor weather.", "An engine caught fire shortly after takeoff and the aircraft was not able to make an emergency landing and crashed.", "The crew had serious problems maintaining their heading after both artificial horizons failed shortly after takeoff. The crew had difficulty controlling the aircraft in turbulent conditions and the plane went into a spiral dive and crashed into a field. One or possibly both of the aircraft's artificial horizons malfunctioned and in the absence of a standby horizon, for which there was no airworthiness requirement, there was no single instrument available for assured attitude reference or simple means of determining which flight instruments had failed. The pilot became spatially disoriented and was unable to maintain control.", "?", "Ditched in the sea just offshore, after losing an engine on approach. The pilot was not rated for that aircraft type and had very little experience.", "As the plane approached  Runway 25,  the right main landing gear did not extend. While the captain continued the descent the co-pilot carried out the landing gear alternate extension checklist. The plane descended below the minimum safe step-down altitudes for the approach and struck the top of a ridge line. The captain did not ensure the aircraft intercepted and maintained the approach profile during the non-precision instrument approach. The captain's  unwise decision to get the landing gear lowered without discontinuing the instrument approach. The captain's distraction from the primary task of flying the aircraft safely during the first officer's attempt  to correct a landing gear malfunction.", "Crashed in poor weather condtions.", "Flying VOR the plane ran into poor weather and the pilot decided to return however crashed into trees while attempting to land.", "The aircraft, carrying members of a local soccer club crashed 10 miles short of it's destination. Adverse weather conditions and overloaded.", "Crashed while landing in heavy rain. Overshot runway, landing long, and collided with a concrete culvert.", "After the cargo flight encountered problems en route, the crew tried to return to Santo Domingo but crashed.", "The cargo plane lost two engines during its flight to Tabubil and subsequent diversion to Kiunga and crashed short of the runway.", "Crashed on takeoff onto a beach in shallow water. An in-flight fire that originated near the rear cargo hold is believed to have started in a passenger's luggage from some type of flammable liquid.", "The plane lost control during takeoff in heavy rain and veered off the runway crashing into a banana plantation.", "The aircraft, carrying a French medical team, crashed while attempting to land at Antananarivo. Double engine failure.", "Shortly after takeoff the plane rolled to the left and struck the ground. Failure of the No. 1 engine.", "During the takeoff cargo shifted in the plane causing the aircraft to lose altitude and crash into power lines.", "Crashed into Mt. Chichontepec volcano at 5,900 ft. at night during heavy rain and thunderstorms. Possible damage to the aircraft's DME due to lightning. Confusion between the pilot and ATC due to bad weather and a diversion. The Ground Proximity Warning System had sounded and power was applied but too late.", "Crashed into Mt. Komawa at 9,200 ft. in poor weather. Found 8/14/95.", "Crashed into Nevado de Huila at an elevation of 14,500 feet.", "Shortly after taking off from Atlanta on a flight to Gulfport, the aircraft experienced propeller separation in the left engine while climbing through FL 180. The aircraft hit trees, crashed into a field and burned while trying to make an emergency landing at West Georgia Regional Airport. The in-flight fatigue fracture and separation of a propeller blade resulting in distortion of the left engine nacelle, causing excessive drag, loss of wing lift, and reduced directional control of the airplane. The fracture was caused by a fatigue crack from multiple corrosion pits that were not discovered by Hamilton Standard because of inadequate and ineffective corporate inspection and repair techniques, training, documentation and communication. Two died of their injuries after the accident.", "While en route the cargo plane flew into a 4,800 ft. mountain. The pilot's continued VFR flight into instrument meteorological conditions. The weather was a factor.", "After climbing to 18,400' msl, the pilot reported a turbocharger problem & reversed course. He said he 'may lose the left engine' & that he was unable to maintain altitude. He diverted to an alternate airport. During a right turn onto final approach, the airplane was observed to cross (overshoot) the extended centerline of the runway. It continued in a right turn back toward the centerline, and then entered a left turn to intercept the inbound course. The turn steepened, and then the airplane entered a spin & crashed 1/2 mile short of the runway. Failure of the pilot to maintain adequate airspeed, while maneuvering on approach, which resulted in an inadvertent stall/spin and uncontrolled collision with terrain. Factors relating to the accident were: the pilot allowed the aircraft weight and balance limitations to be exceeded; the pilot's lack of recurrent training in the make and model of airplane; inadequate maintenance/inspection of the engine exhaust systems; a warped and leaking exhaust system flange on the left engine, which resulted in a loss of power in that engine; and the pilot's improper use of the flaps.", "During a low flying turn manuve, at an air show, the pilot caused the plane to stall and crash into the water. The captain made an error in judgement in modifying one of the display manoeuvres to the extent that he stalled the aircraft at a height and attitude from which recovery was impossible.", "Crashed short of the runway in rain, fog and reduced visibility after diverting from another airport and two landing attempts.", "Crashed after running out of fuel.", "The pilot reported an instrument problem after taking off from Ratmalana Airport and was returning for an emergency landing when the plane fell from 8,000 feet and crashed into the sea.", "Following a visual approach, the aircraft landed long and fast and overran the end of the runway into a shanty town while attempting a go-around.", "The plane crashed into mountains after a premature descent.", "The aircraft suffered multiple bird strikes in the No. 1 and 2 engines just after taking off when it flew into a flock of 100 or more Canada Geese. The crew initiated a slow climb and began to dump fuel. The aircraft attained a maximum altitude of 250 ft. before it started to descend. The plane impacted a hilly wooded area less than a mile from the runway, broke up, exploded and burned.  Ingestion of Canada geese into the Nos.1 and 2 engines. Lack of adequate procedures to reduce bird hazards. The crew was not warned about observations of birds in the area by the ATC.", "Crashed through the ice while attempting to land and sank in shallow water. The weather conditions were below minima and the helicopter exceeded its maximum takeoff weight.", "While on an intercept heading for the final approach and in straight-and-level flight, the aircraft crashed into the side of a 1,047 ft, mountain in heavy fog. The pilot progressively lost situational awareness while attempting to navigate in conditions of low visibility or in cloud and was unaware of the rapidly rising terrain in his flight path.", "Thirty minutes into the flight the aircraft was not able to maintain altitude after oil pressure was lost in the No. 1 engine. Crashed into trees.", "The helicopter crashed into mountains at Barskoon Pass while en route.", "The aircraft crashed into a 8,000 ft. mountain  in the Sierra Grande range while climbing en route from Comodoro Rivadavia to Cordoba in heavy rain and strong turbulence. The passengers included military personnel and their dependents.", "While performing a non-precision approach in poor weather to runway 15 at Bradley International Airport, the plane struck the tops of trees and landed short of the runway. The airplane also impacted a instrument landing system antenna, bounced onto the runway, and landed safely. The flight crew's failure to maintain the required minimum descent altitude until the required visual references identifiable with the runway were in sight. Contributing factors were the failure of the BDL approach controller to furnish the flight crew with a current altimeter setting, and the flight crew's failure to ask for a more current setting.", "The aircraft touched down halfway down the runway, veered off the runway where dry grass caught fire under the aircraft and eventually spread destroying the aircraft.", "Crashed into the Indian Ocean while attempting to land at Palay Air Force Base. Most likely shot down by Tamil rebels.", "Crashed at sea disappearing while en route. Debris found near Labuan Island.  Strong winds and thunderstorms were in the area at the time.", "While attempting to land the cargo plane struck light posts and crashed into a field.", "The plane went into a dive and crashed 6 km short of the runway into a swamp during a second attempt at landing. Loss of power in the No. 1 engine.", "The aircraft crashed shortly after takeoff while attempting to make an emergency landing after the pilot reported problems with the left engine. Vibration caused nuts to work loose from the engine turbine which resulted in engine failure. No fault was found with the right engine and it is believed that it may have been inadvertently shut down by the crew.", "The aircraft crashed into mountainous terrain while en route. Crew error. Fuel-feed selected from wing tanks on one side only, causing an imbalance and banking to the right. The autopilot was able to counteract the imbalance for approximately 35 minutes into the flight.", "The plane crashed and burned shortly after takeoff after reaching a height of 500 ft. Combination of overloading and icing.", "The plane, chartered by the UNITA rebel movement, stalled and crashed shortly after takeoff from Jamba. Overloaded by 40 passengers. One report stated baggage shifted to the rear of the plane.", "While on a flight from Miami, FL to Cali, Columbia the aircraft crashed into Mt. El Deluvio 38 miles north of Cali while attempting to land. On approach, the crew was requested to report over Tulua VOR which they already passed. This confused them and they decided to go direct to Rozo beacon. Entering the abbreviation \"R\", incorrectly steered the plane towards Bogota. More than a minute into the  turn the crew steered manually toward Cali, but this now took them into the path of a mountain. Crew error. Lack of situational awareness, failure to adequately plan and execute the approach, failure to realize that the FMS had turned the aircraft toward mountains. Crew also neglected to retract the speed brakes after the Ground Proximity Warning System alert.  Lack of adequate radar. Different  Flight Management System naming convention from that published in navigational charts.", "Diverted from Madang to Bagasin, overran the runway and crashed."]}
