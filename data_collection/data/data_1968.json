Tobin 300 ft. below the peak and slid 1,000 ft. down the side of the mountain. Turbulent conditions caused the uncontrolled descent. The Salt Lake control center had, in response to its vector request, informed the crew that there were no storm cells and no reports of icing along the airway being used. As a result, the pilot was unaware that turbulence encountered would be hazardous, worse than that predicted at the time of take-off. These turbulent conditions apparently caused the uncontrolled descent of the aircraft into the ground. The pilot was technically not qualified for the type of aircraft and was aware of the general weather conditions and should have discontinued the flight..", "Ice accretion on the lifting surface of the aircraft accompanied by moderate to severe turbulence, which resulted in loss of aircraft control by the pilot. When he tried to regain control over the aircraft the lifting surfaces were loaded beyond approved design limits, which brought about the disintegration of main parts of the aircraft in the air, and its subsequent impact with the ground.", "Touched down on the right side of the runway, bounced, crashed into landing lights and into the sea.  Inadequate supervision of the flight by the pilot-in-command. While attempting to go-around, the flaps were fully extended.", "Vanished without a trace over the Himalayas while en route. The remains of one victim from the plane were found in the Rohtang Pass in August 2003. The wreckage itself and other remains would be found in August 2005.

G. Strijdom Airport, climbed to an altitude of 600 ft. and then descended, crashing, about one minute after taking off 3 miles from the runway. Procedural errors during takeoff . Takeoff conditions in total darkness with no external visual reference. Stabilizer trim improperly set, spatial disorientation and preoccupation with after takeoff duties.", "Crashed while en route after encountering turbulence, possibly leading to a break-up of the aircraft.", "On a flight from Houston to Dallas the airliner flew into thunderstorms. While attempting to turn around by making a right hand turn, winds lifted the port wing, forcing the starboard wing down past 90 degrees.  A stall resulted from this unusual attitude, pitching the nose down. During the recovery maneuver, the starboard wing was over-stressed, separating from the aircraft followed by the the tail and engines. The aircraft crashed into a field. Pilot's decision to penetrate a line of thunderstorms and severe weather.

The crew was not able to determine accurately its position because they had performed a non-standard instrument approach and there were no supplement navigational aids available for their use.", "The plane landed in the shallow waters of San Francisco Bay, 2.5 mile short of the Runway 28L. All 107 people aboard were safely evacuated off the plane without injury. According to the NTSB, the captain said he was making a coupled approach, but because of problems with his pressure altimeter, he was relying on the more accurate radio altimeter for verification of altitude. The captain looked up expecting to be 200 feet above the water but instead was nearly in the water. He applied power but it was too late. The captain did not cross-check the raw data glide-slope signals and didn't realize the ILS on-course position was far above where he was. The  improper application of the prescribed procedures to execute an automatic-coupled ILS approach. This deviation from the prescribed procedures was, in part, due t o a lack of familiarization and infrequent operation of the installed flight director and autopilot system.  As a result, Japan Air Lines changed their training procedures to stress command responsibilities, crew coordination and transition time for new type of aircraft. The aircraft was recovered from the San Francisco Bay 55 hours after the accident, repaired at a United Air Lines facility and eventually flow back to Japan where it was put  in service for many decades.", "While on approach to the airport, in dense fog, the aircraft descended prematurely and its left wing clipped a 30 ft. light pole on the grounds of a fire station 1.8 miles northwest of the runway threshold.

The aircraft rotated and climbed slowly.  The right wing contacted the snow covered ground 94 feet left of the extended centerline at a distance of 2,760 feet from the runway.  The aircraft rolled inverted and broke up.  The probable cause was an attempted takeoff with the flaps in a retracted position. This resulted from a combination of factors: a) inadequate cockpit checklist and procedures; b) a warning system inadequacy associated with cold weather operations; c) ineffective control practices regarding manufacturer's Service Bulletins; and d) stresses imposed upon the crew by their attempts to meet an air traffic control deadline.", "The aircraft crashed during an instrument approach after a go-around, nearly inverted, into a hangar. Spacial disorientation of the crew precipitated by refraction of the landing or approach lights during transition from flying IFR to visual reference to the ground.", "Struck the slope of a mountain west of Soto la Marina in marginal weather,", "Last radio contact  from the aircraft was at 11:34 local 30 DME south of Port Hedland in moderate turbulence. The aircraft was seen descending rapidly. Wreckage was found 28 miles south of Port Hedland. The accident was caused by a crack originating at a bolt hole in the wing spar. Also, it was found that someone  had carried out an incorrect procedure on the spar, by forcing an oversize bush into the housing of the lower spar boom, resulting in damage which exacerbated the spread of the hairline fracture."]}
