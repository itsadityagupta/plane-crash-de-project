The flight recorder revealed that after the the crew lost track of its flight path and moved away from the runway, the plane rapidly lost altitude and crashed to the ground in a period of 7.9 seconds. By the time the two pilots yelled to go around, there was nothing they could do to change the velocity and altitude of the plane in time to prevent a crash. The airport's control tower did not inform the aircraft of local weather conditions.The cause was  pilot error and a failure within the airline to follow safety procedures. The flight crew did not comply with the published runway 20 VOR non-precision instrument approach procedures at Magong Airport with respect to the minimum descent altitude. The captain, as the pilot flying, intentionally descended the aircraft below the published MDA of 330 feet in the instrument meteorological conditions.", "Radar contact was lost 50 minutes after the flight took off from Ouagadougou and after the crew diverted from their planned course due to bad weather. Wreckage was found in the northern mali dessert. The plane was on loan from Swiftair. The crew likely did not activate the system during climb and cruise. As a result of the icing of the pressure sensors, the erroneous information transmitted to the auto throttle meant that the latter limited the thrust delivered by the engines. Under these conditions, the thrust was insufficient to maintain cruise speed and the aircraft slowed down and stalled.", "After taking off, the passenger banked to the right, lost altitude, and crashed into a residential neighborhood, bursting into flames.

The patient was killed and 3 crew members injured.", "The cargo plane impacted a mountainside while en route.", "The aircraft went missing while en route from Suabaya to Singapore. Contact was lost about 40 minutes after taking off. Before contact was lost, the pilot requested a route change due to weather conditions. Preliminary indications are the plane ran into poor weather and stalled from FL320. The rudder travel limiter faulted 3 times during the flight. On the fourth fault the captain decided to try resetting the system by pulling circuit breakers as he had seen a maintenance technician do on the ground. This caused the autopilot to disengage causing the plane to bank 54 degrees. The the first officer, who was flying, became disoriented and was slow to correct the bank. He then put the plane into a steep climb that caused the aircraft to stall and eventually crash. Records show that the plane flew with that mechanical problem for 12 months preceding the accident."]}
