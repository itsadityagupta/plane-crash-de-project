The crew was cruising at FL210 when they reported technical problems. Cleared to divert to Kavala Airport, the pilot made a 180 turn and started the descent. On approach to Kavala Airport at night with one engine on fire, the aircraft entered an uncontrolled descent and crashed at a speed of 200 knots in an agricultural zone located just out of the village of Eleftheroupolis, bursting into flames. The aircraft disintegrated on impact and all eight occupants were killed.", "While on final approach to Bukoba Airport, the crew encountered poor visibility due to heavy rain. Tthe airplane descended too low, and crashed into Lake Victoria, about 100 meters short of runway 31. Both pilots were killed.", "The Airbus A320 collided with a fire truck while it was accelerating for takeoff from Jorge Ch\u00e1vez International Airport in Lima, Peru. The plane was accelerating on runway 16 when it collided with a fire truck, which crossed the active runway without authorization. The crew rejected the takeoff at high speed (at about 130 knots) but wasn't able to avoid contact with the fire truck. As a result of the collision, the right main gear collapsed and caught fire due to the resulting friction against the runway. The aircraft veered right towards the right-hand runway edge coming to a stop partially off the runway about 2500 meters down the runway. Everyone on board was able to evacuate the plane, however, some sustained injuries. Two firefighters in the fire truck were killed.", "The plane was chartered to carry a team of six people from Medell\u00edn to Pizarro, Choco. Shortly after taking off from runway 02 at Medell\u00edn-Enrique Olaya Herrera Airport, the crew encountered engine problems. The airplane lost altitude, went out of control and crashed onto a house, less than one-half mile from the runway end and burst in flames."]}
