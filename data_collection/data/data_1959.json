After reaching  KXNDB (waypoint) they were cleared to descend to 3000 ft.. Galeaoa approach was contacted and normal position reports were made. As the plane descended over Guanabara Bay in rain, the extended nosewheel struck the water. The crew tried to continue the approach, but the aircraft crashed near Flecheiras Beach, short of the runway. The actual cause of the accident was never determined however, the most probable cause was pilot error in descending below the minimum altitude on final approach. Aircrew fatigue was considered to be a contributing factor.  Crew flight time exceeded the Brazilian limits, but did not exceed the German limitations.", "The cargo plane crashed into Panther Peak at 8,500 ft. while en route.", "The aircraft overshot runway and a missed approach procedure was initiated. The plane gradually descended into the ocean just offshore. The pilot was not familiar with the airport and he miscalculated during the instrument approach procedure.

J.P. \"The Big Bopper\" Richardson, who was suffering from the flu, talked Waylon Jennings into giving up his seat. Ritchie Valens won a coin-toss and went in place of Tommy Allsup. He commented \"I never won anything in my life\" after winning the coin-toss. The plane took off into deteriorating weather conditions. The pilot, Roger Peterson, was not certified to fly IFR. The wreckage of the plane was found the next morning in a snowy meadow, 5 miles NW of the airport. The plane hit the ground at a high rate of speed and singers Ritchie Valens, 17, Buddy Holly, 22, Jiles P. \"The Big Bopper\" Richardson, 28, as well as the pilot, were killed instantly. It appeared, the pilot became disoriented and flew the plane into the ground.  Officially: The pilot's decision to undertake a flight in which the likelihood of encountering IFR conditions existed, when he was not certified to fly IFR. Also, deficiencies in the weather briefing and the pilot's unfamiliarity with the instrument which determines the attitude of the aircraft. In later years, a story appeared in the Iowa Globe Gazette in which a pilot, Al Potter, flying in the vicinity of the aircraft that night, claimed he was in contact with the aircraft shortly before it crashed. Potter stated the pilot radioed he had taken on ice and was losing power.", "While attempting to land in rain and fog at La Guardia Airport, the aircraft descended below the minimum altitude and crashed into the East River. The aircraft struck the water while in shallow descent at 150 mph with its landing gear and flaps extended. Primarily the crash resulted from the failure of the crew to properly monitor essential instruments for determining attitude due to preoccupation with particular aspects of the aircraft and its environment. Limited experience of the crew with this particular type of aircraft. Erroneous setting of the captain's altimeter. Possibly misinterpretation of the altimeter and rate of descent indicator.", "While on approach, the jet lost its wings and had its engines torn off as it ploughed 300 yards through the woods and landed upside down with trees embedded in the mangled fuselage and burst into flames.

Navigational error. The pilot entered a wrong valley and stalled the fully loaded aircraft while attempting to turn back.", "The trainee captain attempted a maneuver in disregard of the prescribed limitations of such a maneuver. A two-engine overshoot was attempted at a very low height and below the prescribed minimum speed, when the aircraft was committed to a landing. This resulted in a violent yaw and sharp drop which could not be controlled. The training captain was conversant with the minimum requirements of a two-engine overshoot of the Viscount 815 aircraft but appears to have overestimated his performance.", "The crew failed to recognize and correct the development of excessive yaw which caused an unintentional rolling maneuver at an altitude too low to permit complete recovery.", "Nineteen minutes after taking off and while climbing, the aircraft entered a cloud and struck Mt. Monseny. Pilot did not follow prescribed regulations.", "The aircraft descended below MDA and crashed 5 miles short of the runway while on approach to Asuncion.

No one was charged in either case.", "Crashed shortly after takeoff, 2.5 miles from Beirut Airport. Navigation error. Possible in-flight fire in the No. 1 engine which induced the pilot to start fire emergency action with a resulting reduction in the rate of turn and the rate of climb.", "Shortly after taking off the plane experienced a fire warning in the No. 2 engine, shut it down and attempted to return to Midway Airport. During the final approach the aircraft banked in excess of 45 degrees and developed an excessive sink rate. When the aircraft reached the tops of trees its wings were nearly level and its nose was raised in a climbing attitude but the descent continued and the plane crashed one quarter of a mile southeast of the airport. The accident was the consequence of manuvering the aircraft during the turn to final approach in such a manner as to cause a rate of sink from which recovery was not possible. Sometime during the turn the flaps were retracted from 60% to 24% causing a loss of lift.", "Crashed into Bald Eagle Mountain,13 miles south of Williamsport,  while on an ILS approach to Williamsport.
